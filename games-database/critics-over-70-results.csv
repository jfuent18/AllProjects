75928,1691,Advance Wars,"The story of the Advance Wars begins in the ""Field Training"" tutorial mode, with the nation of Orange Star in a war against the neighboring nation of Blue Moon, with Olaf as the Blue Moon Army commanding officer (CO). Olaf suddenly ordered an invasion of the Orange Star nation and is in battle with the Orange Star Army. The campaign continues the story that started in the tutorial. Nell, the de facto leader of the Orange Star COs, gives the player the duty of a tactical advisor for the Orange Star Army.  The player follows the war effort through all four countries, with its own COs, over the course of the game. Starting with having only one choice of a CO to advise, Andy, the player will have a choice of two more Orange Star COs, Max and Sami, to advise as the story progresses, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Depending on which CO is chosen by the player to advise, there are times when a mission is split into a choice of two or three, where the maps and dialog could be different. After completing that mission, the story paths could split up, depending on which CO was chosen in that previous mission, with the story differing from the other path, eventually leading back to the main path.  After winning a battle against Green Earth, Andy gets mysteriously accused by Green Earth's CO, Eagle, of committing a treacherous act of aggression against Green Earth. After defeating the Blue Moon troops that invaded the Orange Star country, the Orange Star Army then invade the Blue Moon country, defeating their troops. The Blue Moon COs, Olaf and Grit, are revealed to be COs whom both used to work for the Orange Star Army, but switched to Blue Moon. When the Orange Star Army's intention was to just pass through the other two countries, Green Earth and Yellow Comet, the countries' COs like Kanbei of Yellow Comet assume a threat of an invasion and declare battles against the Orange Star Army in their land.  Later on, Green Earth CO Drake tells Eagle that the Orange Star Army didn't attack Green Earth, saying that ""This entire conflict has been orchestrated from the beginning."" Meanwhile, Yellow Comet CO Sonja and Grit try to discover the person who is really behind the attacks. When Eagle meets Andy again, Eagle again accuses Andy of attacking Green Earth, to which the Orange Star COs eventually convince Eagle that it wasn't Andy who attacked Green Earth. This explains why the three nations have been declaring battles against Orange Star, as they thought Andy attacked them first.  When Eagle meets Sonja, Sonja also tells Eagle that Andy wasn't behind the attacks, saying it was someone else, and goes with her to see what she discovered. It is revealed that the enigmatic Black Hole Army, under the command of Sturm, is the true enemy. Using a CO doppelganger clone of Andy, Sturm stirred up war among the four countries in order to confuse, weaken, and eventually conquer them. Once this is revealed, the four countries unite to drive Black Hole out of their land, the Cosmo Land, with COs automatically chosen depending on the paths the player took during the game.",2001-09-10 00:00:00.000,34,NULL,100.0000,1,81.6547,82

92713,77336,The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past & Four Swords,"In A Link to the Past The intro to A Link to the Past reveals the back story of the game, showing that series antagonist Ganon was sealed away after his bid for the Triforce. However, the seal has grown weak, and a wizard named Agahnim has taken over the throne of Hyrule, and is kidnapping the seven descendants of the Sages who sealed away Ganon, which includes Princess Zelda. The game opens with series protagonist Link receiving a message from Zelda, telling him to come save her. Following his Uncle, he finds him near death, and is tasked by his Uncle to find and rescue Zelda, giving him his sword and shield before dying. After Link reaches the dungeons, he frees Zelda from her cage, and takes her through a hidden sewer into a Sanctuary, where she remains hidden. The man in the Sanctuary tells Link of Agahnim's plan to break the seal the Sages placed, requiring Link to obtain the Master Sword. Link travels across Hyrule, aided by a man named Sahasrahla, collecting three pendants from the three dungeons, using them to unseal the Master Sword in the Lost Woods. Link returns to Hyrule Castle with the Master Sword after Zelda is kidnapped. When he meets Agahnim, he finds that he is too late, as Agahnim teleports her away.  After battling and defeating Agahnim, he takes Link into the Sacred Realm, which has been corrupted and transformed into the Dark World by Ganon. He is tasked with rescuing the seven Maidens who have been sealed away in crystals, as well as finding magical items called the Silver Arrows. Link eventually rescues Zelda, and uses the Maidens' power to break into Ganon's Tower. After fighting and defeating Agahnim for the second time, Ganon flies from Agahnim's corpse into the Pyramid of Power. Link follows, doing battle with him. He eventually defeats Ganon, and finds the Triforce. After the Triforce speaks to Link, Link uses it to wish for Hyrule to return to normal. Afterward, he returns the Master Sword to where he found it. If the player has completed Four Swords, they may find an alternate ending by beating a secret dungeon. This dungeon features four Dark Links, in reference to the four Links in the Four Swords game. After defeating them, an ending showing the inhabitants of the Dark World and the various bosses is shown.  In Four Swords Taking place before the events of Ocarina of Time, the prologue shows Link and Zelda approaching a sword in a pedestal, called the Four Sword.

The Guardians then banished Crota's soul and eventually killed Crota himself. They also destroyed a Shrine communing with Oryx and killed its protector, Sardok.  Eris Morn alerted Mara Sov of Oryx's arrival, and the Queen set out with the Awoken Armada to Saturn, where the Taken King's Dreadnaught had stopped to refuel. Uldren Sov led his fighter wings to attack the Dreadnaught and engage the fleet of Tombships protecting it, with the Queen and Oryx presiding over the battle from their respective flagships.  With help from her Coven of Techeun Witches, the Queen summoned her Harbingers, deadly orbs that could decimate an army in seconds. The Harbingers bombarded the Dreadnaught, but after the explosions faded away there seemed to be no lasting marks on the battlecruiser. Oryx then fired the ship's superweapon, which ripped a hole through the rings of Saturn and completely destroyed the Awoken fleet. Queen Mara and many other major parts of the Reef's leadership, including Paladin Abra Zire and Techeun Shuro Chi, have since disappeared and are considered MIA, while Petra Venj has advised a remaining Paladin to declare all of them dead.  Attack on Phobos Meanwhile, the Vanguard intercepted a distress signal on all channels, broadcasted from the Skyburners fortress Fleetbase Korus on Phobos. A Guardian is dispatched to Phobos, and they witness a strange new enemy slaughtering the Skyburners. Oryx contacts the Guardians, willing into existence an army of corrupted Cabal and Hive called the Taken. The Guardian defeats these Taken, overcoming Syrok, Word of Oryx. They then attempt to escape the Skyburner Keep via the Aerodrome landing pad, which is riddled with Taken. The Guardian reaches the landing pad and escapes Phobos in their ship.  From then, Oryx's master plan is revealed: He will enslave as many Cabal, Vex, Fallen, and his own Hive as he can, and use them to bring the system into ruin. Initially, one of his consorts, Ecthar (who also fluently speaks English), tells him to only retrieve the strongest of the four races and bring the rest to nigh-extinction, but Oryx objects to Ecthar's advice.  Realizing that the Taken are too deadly a threat to take lightly, the Vanguard send Guardians to rediscover lost powers of their forebearers. The Hunter gains the Nightstalker class and the Shadowshot super ability, the Warlock gains the Stormcaller class and the Stormtrance super ability, and the Titan gains the Sunbreaker class and the Hammer of Sol super ability.",2015-09-15 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,100.0000,0,NULL,NULL

165575,7893,Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2,"Soul Reaver 2 is set in Nosgoth, a fictional land with fantasy aspects. In the first game in the series, Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain embarks on a journey to restore the Pillars of Nosgoth—nine supernatural edifices which are inextricably tied to the health of the land, but become corrupted. During his adventure, Moebius, a manipulative sorcerer, tricks Kain into orchestrating the destruction of the vampire race: Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth. After restoring eight of the Pillars, Kain discovers that he would need to sacrifice his own life to restore the final corrupt one. Realizing that his death would ensure the annihilation of his species, he refuses to kill himself. This triggers the Pillars' collapse, and dooms the world to eternal decay, but enables Kain to live on and revive the vampire race.    By the time of Soul Reaver, 1500 years later, Kain is a despotic emperor, his vampires dominate the land, and Nosgoth hinges on the brink of collapse. The Elder God, a demiurge-like entity, lurks beneath Nosgoth and controls the cycle of reincarnation; the vampires, whose biological immortality opposes his doctrine, are his enemies. In Soul Reaver, Raziel—Kain's lieutenant—is executed by Kain, but The Elder God resurrects him and encourages him to exact revenge. Traversing the wasteland and murdering the vampires, Raziel confronts Kain, who attacks him with the Soul Reaver sword, imbued with a spirit which absorbs its victims' souls. The Soul Reaver shatters when it strikes Raziel, and the blade's spirit binds itself to his arm. His motives still mysterious, Kain lures Raziel through a time portal into Nosgoth's past.    In Soul Reaver 2, it is established that, in Nosgoth, fatalism is an actuality—history is immutable, and all individuals are subject to predestination. Raziel, due to his paradoxical destiny, is the only exception to this rule—his presence enables temporal paradoxes to be triggered, altering history for better or worse. Kain relies on Raziel's free will in a bid to outsmart Moebius and resolve the dilemma he faced in Blood Omen, ultimately hoping to enable both the restored Pillars and the vampire race to co-exist in the future. Soul Reaver 2 opens as Raziel emerges from the time slip and is greeted by Moebius, having arrived in an era 30 years prior to the events of Blood Omen. Two further time periods, 100 years after and 500 years before Blood Omen respectively, are also explored as the story progresses.",2001-10-31 00:00:00.000,25,NULL,95.0000,2,84.5720,68

As the character approaches the mountain, they find remnants of a once-thriving civilization, eroded by sand over time.

The player continues to journey deeper into the remains of a once sprawling city at the base of the mountain. Eventually making it safely to the mountain, the traveler begins to climb it, struggling as they enter the colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds. With the crevice still a fair distance away, the traveler falls and collapses in the snow. Six of the white-robed figures appear and grant the traveler new energy, allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and walk into and through the crevice as the screen fills with white.

169590,382,Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker,"Four years after the events of the San Hieronymo incident, Big Boss—who prefers his original title, Snake—and Kaz Miller have established Militaires Sans Frontières, a small mercenary faction, on the Colombian coast. They are approached by Ramon Galvez Mena, a professor at the University of Peace, and his student, Paz Ortega Andrade. Galvez attempts to hire MSF to investigate an army that has discreetly occupied parts of Costa Rica. Snake refuses, identifying Galvez as a KGB agent, but is convinced when Paz plays a recording of The Boss.    When Snake arrives in Costa Rica, he begins to suspect that the mystery army has brought nuclear weapons with them. Enlisting the help of the Sandinista Liberation Army, he tracks a shipment to a research facility deep in the mountains. His suspicions are confirmed when he witnesses Hot Coldman, a senior CIA agent, announce his intentions to fire a live nuclear weapon as part of a project code-named ""Peace Walker,"" a fail-deadly nuclear tank. Snake reveals himself to Huey Emmerich, one of Peace Walker's designers, who agrees to help him stop Coldman.    Following Huey's instructions, Snake ventures deeper into Costa Rica, searching for Dr. Strangelove, the designer of Peace Walker's artificial intelligence systems. He discovers that Strangelove has based Peace Walker's primary control systems on The Boss' personality. She demands to know whether The Boss genuinely defected to the Soviet Union, or if she died on a mission that was covered up, going so far as to torture Snake for information.    Snake escapes custody and attempts in vain to destroy Peace Walker, a quadrupedal nuclear launch platform. He chases Peace Walker across the Nicaraguan border to an American airbase on the shores of Lake Cocibolca. Discovering that the base has been occupied by Soviet soldiers, Snake infiltrates the facility to confront Coldman. Coldman reveals the purpose of Peace Walker: he believes that nuclear deterrence is a flawed theory, relying on humans to retaliate in the event of a nuclear exchange, whom he believes to be unwilling to destroy their own race. As an impartial artificial intelligence, Peace Walker would guarantee retaliation, and Coldman intends to fire a warhead to prove it. Suddenly, the facility is overrun by Soviet soldiers, led by Galvez, who reveals himself as Vladimir Zadornov. Zadornov intends to hijack Peace Walker for the Soviet Union, but the standoff is broken by the arrival of MSF and the Sandinistas, giving Snake enough time to destroy Peace Walker.    In the aftermath of the battle, Zadornov is captured and Coldman mortally wounded. In his dying moments, Coldman activates Peace Walker's data uplink, convincing NORAD that the United States is about to be hit by a Soviet nuclear strike. Snake contacts NORAD, and tries to convince them to stand down, but senior members of the armed forces refuse and plan to retaliate. With a nuclear strike imminent, The Boss' personality takes control of Peace Walker's damaged artificial intelligence and drowns Peace Walker in Lake Cocibolca, severing the connection and ending the threat.    Some time later, Zadornov repeatedly escapes from MSF, arousing Snake's suspicions that someone has betrayed them. Paz reveals herself to be the traitor, using Zadornov's escapes to seize control of Metal Gear ZEKE, a walking tank designed by Huey to act as MSF's deterrent against foreign intervention.

169171,143292,Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition,"After the attack on D6, Artyom becomes disillusioned with the constant infighting and corruption within the Metro and leaves the Spartan Order. He soon becomes obsessed with proving that other human survivors exist outside of Moscow and makes numerous dangerous expeditions to the surface, much to Anna's concern and Miller's frustration. However, on one such expedition with Anna, they witness a working train running on the surface. Before they can follow it, they are captured by Hansa soldiers, along with a group of people who claim to be from outside of Moscow. The Hansa soldiers execute the other prisoners, and Artyom is shot and left for dead, taking Anna to their base. Surviving the gunshot, Artyom follows the soldiers to rescue Anna, and in the process inadvertently destroys a signal jammer that was blocking all communications going in and out of Moscow. Radio transmissions from all over the world begin to be picked up, and Artyom and Anna realise humanity has not gone extinct. They escape by stealing one of Hansa's locomotives, the ""Aurora"", with the aid of a defected Hansa train engineer called Yermak.  As the train leaves, the Spartan Order moves in to retake it and are shocked and confused at Artyom and Anna's presence. Knowing that Hansa will have all of them put to death for knowing the truth, Miller concludes that the Spartans' best chance of survival is to flee Moscow. Once outside the city, he reveals to the others that while many of Russia's cities were bombed, the war did not end and NATO proceeded to occupy what was left of the nation. To prevent NATO from attacking Moscow, the Russian leadership decided to secretly jam all communications to make the outside world believe nobody had survived. They then receive a radio broadcast from Moscow Defense Command calling for survivors to rally at the ""Ark"", located at Mount Yamantau. Miller decides to head there, believing that the Ark is where the Russian government has rebuilt itself.  After crossing the cult-controlled Volga River, the Spartans reach the Yamantau base. They discover the base's service and construction crew have devolved into cannibals who lure survivors in with the false promise of safety. Artyom and the Spartans manage to fight their way out and escape, but Miller's faith in Russia is shattered when he discovers that the government never took refuge in Yamantau, nor survived the war, and thus the Spartans are left wondering what to do next. Using a map they recovered from Yamantau, they decide to travel to a satellite communication center near the Caspian Sea in the hopes of gaining access to a satellite to find habitable land to settle. At the dried up remains of the Caspian Sea, the Spartans steal water and fuel from the local bandits while obtaining an updated satellite map.  As the Spartans continue on their journey, Anna begins to cough up blood, fearing the cause was accidentally breathing poison gas during the journey. They decide to scout a nearby taiga forest valley to see if it is suitable to settle. While scouting the forest, Artyom is caught between two rival survivor factions, and he discovers that the dam protecting the valley from radiation is on the verge of failing, making the area uninhabitable. Artyom returns to the train to learn Anna's condition has worsened. The Spartans detour to the heavily-irradiated city of Novosibirsk, the closest location where an antidote may be found.  Miller and Artyom decide to head into the city alone to search for the antidote despite the risk. They enter the Novosibirsk Metro and find a young boy named Kirill, one of the last of the Novosibirsk survivors, who explains that his father left on a mission to obtain a map marking the location of a clean, habitable area. Miller and Artyom split up, with Miller going to find the map and Artyom searching for the antidote. He manages to recover the antidote, but is gravely wounded by a mutant and absorbs a heavy dose of radiation. Artyom, Miller, and Kirill return to the train with the map and the antidote, but Miller dies of radiation poisoning on the way back after using a dose of anti-radiation serum meant for himself to save Artyom. The rest of the Spartans donate their own blood to give Artyom a critical blood transfusion. Anna is cured with the antidote and with the map, the Spartans settle on the shores of Lake Baikal, which is completely free from radiation.  Artyom's ultimate fate depends on the choices the player made during the journey; In the bad ending, Artyom dies from the radiation poisoning, and the Spartans and a grieving Anna hold a funeral for him and Miller while Artyom's and Miller's spirits awaken on a dilapidated version of the Aurora, remaining in the ghostly purgatory for eternity. In the good ending, Artyom survives. Miller is buried and Artyom is selected to take his place as leader of the Spartan Order. Now with a home free from radiation, Artyom decides to return to Moscow and reveal the truth of the world to the survivors of the Metro.",2021-05-06 00:00:00.000,6,NULL,91.5000,3,NULL,NULL

172632,501,Batman: Arkham City,"At a press conference held by Bruce Wayne to declare his opposition to Arkham City, TYGER mercenaries arrest and imprison him in Arkham City. Hugo Strange discloses his knowledge of Wayne's dual identity as Batman before releasing him into the prison's criminal populace. While Strange prepares to commence ""Protocol 10"", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred Pennyworth, allowing him to become Batman. He first saves Catwoman from being executed by Two-Face, who hopes to gain respect by murdering her. After Joker attempts to assassinate Catwoman, Batman tracks him to his hideout in the Sionis Steelmill, believing Joker may know the truth behind Protocol 10.    There, Batman learns that the unstable properties of the Titan formula are mutating in Joker's blood, gradually killing him. Joker captures Batman and performs a blood transfusion on him, infecting him with the same fatal disease. Joker also reveals that Gotham hospitals have been poisoned with his infected blood. Desperate to save himself and innocent citizens, Batman seeks out Mr. Freeze, who had been developing a cure but has since been kidnapped by the Penguin.    Tracking Penguin to the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute, Batman defeats his forces, his imprisoned monster Solomon Grundy, and ultimately the Penguin himself, before liberating Mr. Freeze. Freeze tells Batman that he has already developed the cure, but its instability renders it useless. Batman deduces that the restorative properties of Ra's al Ghul's blood can complete the cure. Batman tracks one of Ra's al Ghul's assassins to his underground lair, leading Batman into a confrontation with Ra's and his daughter Talia, Batman's former lover. With Ra's al Ghul's blood, Freeze is able to develop an antidote, but it is stolen by Harley Quinn before Batman can use it.    When he returns to the Joker, Batman finds him restored to health. While the two fight, Strange activates Protocol 10, which is revealed to be a scheme to wipe out the entire population of Arkham City and destroy the criminal element of Gotham. The TYGER troops begin executing inmates as Strange launches missile strikes on Arkham's denizens from his base in Wonder Tower. A missile hits the steelmill, burying Batman under rubble. Before Joker can take advantage of the situation, Talia arrives and offers him immortality in exchange for sparing Batman's life. After escaping with the help of Catwoman, Batman is convinced by Alfred to end Protocol 10 before pursuing Talia and Joker.    Batman infiltrates Wonder Tower and disables Protocol 10. Ra's al Ghul is revealed to be the true mastermind behind Arkham City and mortally wounds Strange for failing to defeat Batman. With his dying breath, Strange activates ""Protocol 11"", the self-destruction of Wonder Tower. Batman and Ra's escape, but Ra's commits suicide rather than risk capture. Joker contacts Batman, threatening to kill Talia unless Batman meets him at the Monarch Theater. Once Batman arrives, Joker demands the cure but is stabbed and apparently killed by Talia while distracted. Talia admits to stealing the cure from Quinn, when she is killed by a second Joker, still stricken with the disease. The healthy Joker that Talia stabbed then reanimates into the shapeshifting Clayface, who is revealed to have been masquerading as a healthy Joker all along at the ailing villain's request.    Batman incapacitates Clayface, but Joker blows up the theater floor, sending Batman plummeting into Ra's' lair below. Batman destroys Ra's' rejuvenating Lazarus Pit before the Joker can use it, and drinks a portion of the antidote. Batman debates curing his foe but is attacked by Joker before he can act, causing the antidote vial to inadvertently smash. Batman admits that in spite of everything Joker had done, he would have saved him. After Joker finally succumbs to his illness and dies, Batman carries his body out of Arkham City. As Commissioner Gordon asks what happened, Batman places Joker's body on the hood of a police car and leaves in silence.",2011-10-18 00:00:00.000,611,NULL,91.2000,13,87.4013,1658

144083,145004,Total War: Rome Remastered,"Total War: ROME REMASTERED is a modernized remaster of ROME: Total War (2004). It is a strategy game set in ancient Rome, where players manage their faction with the aim to defeat other rival factions, conquer ancient Rome and become emperor, using a combination of diplomatic, military and economic tactics. Gameplay takes place on an accurate representation of ancient Rome and surrounding countries and is divided into two core elements.  1) The Campaign map – This is a turn-based campaign map in which the player is able to recruit and train troops, manage cities & towns through building, progresses through technologies, engage in diplomacy, start wars in order to achieve domination over other competing factions. The aim on the campaign map is to take territory from other factions and dominate the map. This is done through a combination of military (moving and positioning armies across a map) and non-military strategies (which can be achieved via trade & diplomacy, and/or by deploying agents to uncover information about rivals).  2) The Battles – there are real time 3D land battles with a high level of graphical realism. These result from the movement and clash of armies on the campaign map. Players control their army in real time against their opponent, in a 3D map environment. Armies are broken into units which can be controlled individually or as a combination. Units can be ordered in various ways to move and attack, in an effort to defeat the enemy. There are various broad types of units to choose from, each with their own stats (ie: infantry, ranged infantry, cavalry, siege etc.). A battle is resolved once one persons army is defeated.  Players can choose to play:  - The main campaign as one of a number of factions (certain factions are only playable once they have been defeated in the core campaign)  - A Historical Battle: pre-set conditions, representing historically accurate battles  - Custom Battle: players can customise their battle (ie: choose factions, conditions, etc.)  - Quick Battle: players are placed into a random battle scenario  - Multiplayer: against other players (online)  Total War: ROME REMASTERED contains two expansion packs that were originally released separately for ROME: Total War (2004):  - ROME: Total War - BARBARIAN INVASION  - ROME: Total War - ALEXANDER  Both of these expansion packs have been remastered alongside the base game and are part of the core product.",2021-04-29 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,91.0000,1,NULL,NULL

172470,987,Halo 3,"After the events of the comic tie-in Halo: Uprising, the Master Chief crashes in eastern Africa, where he is found by Johnson and the Arbiter. The Chief, Johnson, and company fight Covenant in the jungle and arrive at a UNSC outpost. Here, Keyes and Lord Hood plan a final effort to stop the Covenant leader, the High Prophet of Truth, from activating a Forerunner artifact uncovered outside the ruins of the city of New Mombasa. The Chief clears anti-air Covenant defenses so Hood can lead the last of Earth's ships against the Prophet, but Truth activates the buried artifact, creating a slipspace portal which he and his followers enter. A Flood-infested ship crash-lands nearby; Elite forces arrive and vitrify Flood-infected areas of Earth, stopping the threat. Following a message Cortana left aboard the Flood ship, the Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes and their troops follow Truth through the portal. Joining them is 343 Guilty Spark, who aids the Chief as he has no function to fulfill after the destruction of his ringworld. Traveling through the portal, the humans and Elites discover an immense artificial structure known as the Ark, far beyond the edges of the Milky Way galaxy. Here, Truth can remotely activate all the Halos. The Flood arrive aboard High Charity in full force, beginning to infest the installation. Truth captures Johnson, as he needs a human to use Forerunner technology. Keyes is killed attempting a rescue, and Johnson is forced to activate the rings. Gravemind forges a truce with the Chief and Arbiter to stop Truth. The Arbiter, Master Chief, and Flood forces arrive and overwhelm Truth's guards, rescuing Johnson and halting the installations' activation. After the Arbiter kills Truth, Gravemind turns on the Chief and Arbiter. The Chief, Arbiter and Guilty Spark discover that the Ark is constructing another Halo to replace the one that the Chief previously destroyed. The Chief decides to activate this Halo; the ringworld would eliminate the Flood infestation on the Ark while sparing the galaxy at large from destruction. To activate the ring, the Chief rescues Cortana, who has the Activation Index of the destroyed Halo, from High Charity and destroys the city. Arriving on the new Halo, Cortana warns that Gravemind is trying to rebuild itself on the ring. The Chief, Arbiter, and Johnson travel to Halo's control room to activate the ring. Guilty Spark explains that because the ring is not yet complete, a premature activation will destroy it and the Ark. When Johnson ignores his warning, Guilty Spark fatally wounds him to protect ""his"" ring. The Chief destroys Guilty Spark, activates the ring, and escapes the ring's self-destruction on the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn. However, the force of Halo's blast causes the slipspace portal to collapse, resulting in only the front half of Forward Unto Dawn, carrying the Arbiter, making it back to Earth. A memorial service is held on Earth for the fallen heroes of the Human-Covenant war, during which the Arbiter and Lord Hood briefly exchange words regarding the fallen Master Chief. After the memorial service, the Arbiter and his Elite brethren depart for their home planet, Sanghelios. Meanwhile, the rear half of the Forward Unto Dawn drifts in unknown space. Cortana drops a distress beacon, but acknowledges it may be many years before they are rescued. The Chief enters cryonic sleep, telling Cortana to ""wake me, when you need me."" If the game is completed at the Legendary difficulty level, the scene continues to show the piece of Forward Unto Dawn drifting towards an unknown planet, revealed in the sequel to be known as ""Requiem"", the primary setting of the campaign of Halo 4.",2007-09-25 00:00:00.000,194,1,90.7500,6,85.8362,543

Along with the original Black Hole army's commanding officers (COs), four new COs were recruited, under the command of Sturm. Sturm orders each Black Hole CO to invade and capture each of the four continents controlled by the four other armies from the original game: Orange Star was to be taken by Flak, Blue Moon by Lash, Yellow Comet by Adder, and Green Earth by Hawke. Lash also invented several new war weapons like the Black Cannon and the Mini Cannons that were to be put to use in this invasion. The four allied armies must now work together to drive Black Hole out of their world once and for all.  Once the Black Hole troops are driven from the Allied Nations' continents, their COs convene in Black Hole territory, near Black Hole's base of operations. Here they fight Sturm, the mastermind behind the invasion. The final battle takes place in front of the Death Ray, a powerful new weapon guarding the entrance to a missile, which, if not subdued in time, would destroy half of Wars World.  The Death Ray is eventually destroyed by the COs of the Allied Nations, who manage to disarm the missile and corner Sturm. In an act of desperation, Sturm attempts to blow up the base and inflict damage on Wars World by self-destructing the missile. Andy attempts to stop Sturm to no avail. However, in a surprising turn of events, Hawke, second in command to Sturm, betrays his leader by killing him with Black Storm before the self-destruct is triggered.

173270,1983,Bastion,"The game takes place in the aftermath of the Calamity, a catastrophic event that suddenly fractured the city of Caelondia as well as the surrounding areas of the game's world into many floating pieces, disrupting its ecology and reducing most of its people to ash. Players take control of the Kid, a silent protagonist who awakens on one of the few remaining pieces of the old world and sets off for the eponymous Bastion, where everyone was supposed to go in troubled times. The only survivor he meets there is an elderly man named Rucks, the game's narrator, who instructs him to collect the Cores that once powered Caelondia. A device in the Bastion can use the power of the crystalline Cores to create landmasses and structures, as well as enable the Kid to travel farther afield via ""skyways"" that propel him through the air.  During his quest, the Kid meets two more survivors: Zulf, an ambassador from the Ura, underground-dwelling people with whom Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl who was raised in Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, but upon reading a journal that the Kid discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists (""Mancers"") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the weapon to backfire, so that when he was finally forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well.  To repair Zulf's damage to the Bastion, the Kid starts collecting Shards, a lesser form of Cores. As he obtains the penultimate shard needed, the Ura attack the Bastion, damaging it and abducting Zia. In the next seven days, The Kid engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory. When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia, she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion had the ability to somehow fix the Calamity. The Kid travels to the once-underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last shard. There, he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people: the battle with Kid has devastated the Ura forces, and they blame Zulf for bringing the Kid to their home. The Kid can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him. If he leaves Zulf behind, the Kid destroys the remnants of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. If he chooses to carry Zulf, Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch silently as the Kid and Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion.  After the Kid returns and recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He can have the Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity in the hopes of preventing it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe.

The economies of both powers depend on a precious multipurpose mineral called Ragnite. Its growing scarcity results in the Empire declaring war on the Federation, sparking the Second Europan War. The Empire uses its military superiority to quickly put the Federation on the defensive. Emboldened by their progress and momentum, the Empire decides to invade the neutral Principality of Gallia in order to seize its rich Ragnite deposits.  When Imperial forces launch an attack on the Gallian border town of Bruhl, Welkin Gunther, son of late Gallian national hero General Belgen Gunther, is forced to fight for his life alongside the town watch captain, Alicia Melchiott. Together with Welkin's adopted sister Isara and using Belgen's prototype tank from the first war, the Edelweiss, they escape to Gallia's capital, Randgriz, and subsequently join the country's militia forces. Welkin is given the rank of lieutenant and assumes command of the newly-formed Squad 7, with Alicia acting as his non-commissioned officer. Initially, members of the squad question Welkin's qualifications due to a lack of combat experience; however, he quickly earns their trust and loyalty with his tactical genius.

However, he is betrayed by his fence and ambushed after an early mission, and he determines that Truart, the local sheriff, is hunting him. Keepers take Garrett to hear a prophecy about the ""Metal Age"", which he ignores. As Garrett leaves, one of the Keepers informs him that Truart had been hired to kill him, and he gives Garrett a letter that directs him to eavesdrop on a Mechanist meeting. There, Garrett overhears Truart and Father Karras discussing the conversion of street people into mindless ""Servants"", who wear masks that emit a red vapor capable of reducing themselves and nearby humans to rust. Truart promises to provide Karras with twenty victims for the Servant project, not realizing that Karras is recording his words for use in blackmail. Garrett steals the recording from a safe deposit box, in order to coerce Truart into revealing his employer.    However, Garrett finds Truart murdered at his estate. Evidence at the crime scene leads him to spy on the police officer Lt. Mosley. Garrett sees Mosley deliver a suspicious letter, which is carried through a portal by a wounded pagan. Garrett enters the portal and finds himself outside the City, and he follows the pagan's trail of blood to Viktoria, who persuades Garrett to join her against the Mechanists. On a lead from Viktoria, he infiltrates Karras' office to learn about the ""Cetus Project"",[31] and inadvertently discovers that Karras is giving Servants to the City's nobles. Garrett travels to a Mechanist base to find out more about the Cetus Project, which is revealed to be a submarine. In order to locate and kidnap a high-ranking Mechanist named Brother Cavador, Garrett stows away in the vehicle.    After delivering Cavador to Viktoria, Garrett steals a Servant mask to learn about a Mechanist technology called a ""Cultivator"". Meanwhile, Karras hides inside the Mechanist cathedral in preparation for his plan. Garrett and Viktoria learn that it is the Cultivators inside Servant masks which emit red vapor, or ""rust gas"". Karras had provided Servants to nobles with gardens in order to set off an apocalyptic chain reaction. Viktoria plans to lure the Servants into the hermetically sealed Mechanist cathedral before Karras activates their masks, but Garrett believes this to be too dangerous and leaves. Viktoria goes to the cathedral alone and dies while filling it with plants, and Garrett completes her plan, killing Karras in the rust gas. Afterward, Garrett is approached by a Keeper who explains that Karras' scheme and Viktoria's death had been prophesied.

Years pass; after honing his skills, Maze informs the Hero of a blind seeress living among a bandit camp near Oakvale, and advises the Hero to infiltrate the bandit camp. To the Hero's surprise, the blind seeress is actually his older sister Theresa who was taken in by Twinblade, a former Hero and the present Bandit King. After a showdown with Twinblade, the Hero is given the choice of killing or sparing the bandit.  Later on in the Hero's life, after he has gained more recognition among the people of Albion, he is invited to fight in the Arena, where he meets the legendary Hero named Jack of Blades, who runs the arena battles. As a final challenge, Jack pits the Hero against his rival, which was also once his childhood friend/room-mate back in the Guild - Whisper; when the Hero defeats her he may kill or spare her.  The Hero learns that Jack of Blades himself destroyed Oakvale during the Hero's childhood; aided by Theresa, the Hero discovers his mother alive in Bargate Prison. The Hero is captured in the rescue attempt and spends a year or more in the prison before finally escaping. Maze is revealed to be a traitor and working with Jack. Maze kidnaps Theresa. After defeating Maze, the Hero is led into a final confrontation with Jack where his mother is killed. Jack reveals that The Sword of Aeons can only be wielded if it receives the blood of Archon. The Sword of Aeons is said to be a very powerful sword of destruction. Upon the death of their mother, the Hero and Theresa are the only two remaining descendants of Archon, and if Jack destroys them both the sword will be even more powerful. After defeating Jack, the Hero must choose whether to keep the Sword of Aeons by killing his sister, or cast it away forever into a portal created by Jack of Blades' death.  Depending on the Hero's alignment and the player's choice of using or destroying the sword, there are a total of four different endings. Once the ending credits roll, players can resume their games.  In The Lost Chapters special edition, the story continues. After the defeat of Jack, the Hero must find passage to the Northern Wastes to aid a legendary hero named Scythe in stopping an unknown great evil from returning. Should the hero have discarded the Sword of Aeons he will have the opportunity to gain the sword ""Avo's Tear"", a sword of similar design and equal power but that holds a light alignment rather than dark.

He must then defeat Jack of Blades a second time, Jack having returned from the dead in the form of a dragon. Upon the death of Jack, the hero then uses Jack's mask to capture Jack's soul, with Scythe telling him that the battle is not over and that he must destroy the mask.

The small black dots of the Luftwaffe getting bigger by the minute. The whistling of the dive bombers approaching on that fateful day of February 1941. And if you touch the charred wood, you can even hear the warning calls and the waves of panic resonating through time. And then again, maybe you’ll hear nothing at all. Maybe you’ll only feel the weight of the silence, broken only by the wind in the branches of old trees. Maybe you’ll only feel the weight of this unanswered question: could that fateful attack explain what happened here? Is it enough to explain why the whole population fled the village? That’s when you look beyond the village limits, when you look up and see its shape: Blackwood Manor. Behind its gates, the silence of Oakmarsh takes on a different taste. Icy, metallic, faint, swollen with secrets that won’t stand still. Blackwood. The name of a manor and the family that lived within. A perverted and mad lineage, a clan whose final members devoted their life to mysticism and fanatical experiments. I am Abigail. Abigail Blackwood.

The premise of the original series is the eternal conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Circle of the Moon's protagonist, however, is Nathan Graves, whose parents died a decade ago to banish Dracula. Morris Baldwin, who helped in Dracula's banishment, trained him to defeat Dracula and the monsters; Morris ultimately chose him as his successor and gave him the ""Hunter Whip"", to the displeasure of Hugh, Morris' son who trained alongside him.  At an old castle, Camilla, a minion of Dracula, revives him, only to be interrupted by the arrival of Morris, Nathan, and Hugh. Before they are able to banish him again, Dracula destroys the floor under Nathan and Hugh, causing them to plummet down a long tunnel. Surviving the fall and wishing to find his father, Hugh leaves Nathan behind. Nathan proceeds to search the castle for his mentor. Along the way, he learns that at the next full moon, Morris' soul will be used to return Dracula to full power. He also periodically encounters Hugh, who becomes more hostile as the game progresses. Eventually, Nathan encounters Camilla, who hints that she and Dracula are responsible for the changes in his personality. Nathan vanquishes Camilla in her true form and meets up with Hugh once more. Upon seeing him, Hugh immediately attacks him with the goal of proving himself to his father through Nathan's defeat; Nathan, however, realizes that Dracula is controlling Hugh. Nathan defeats him, and Dracula's control over Hugh breaks. Confessing that he doubted his self-worth when Nathan was chosen as successor, Hugh tasks him with Morris' rescue.  Arriving at the ceremonial room, Nathan confronts Dracula, who confirms that he had tampered with Hugh's soul to cause the changes in his personality. They begin to fight and halfway through, Dracula teleports away to gain his full power. Hugh then frees his father and tasks Nathan with Dracula's banishment. Nathan continues the battle and defeats Dracula; escaping the collapsing castle, he reunites with Morris and Hugh. Nathan is declared a master vampire hunter by Morris.

It was designed and equipped to be ideally suited for the ultimate challenge: to meet and study extraterrestrial sentient life-forms. Equal care was taken with the crew. Only the most prominent scientists were selected and trained to ideally represent planet Earth. Everything was perfectly planned and success was certain. Yet somehow, everything has gone terribly wrong…  Now, imagine being jolted awake by an emergency alarm. As your surroundings come into focus, you realize you were deep in cryogenic sleep on a vast space probe. But why you are there is an elusive memory. Disoriented, you rush to the control room searching for answers. Once there you learn from the ship’s AI that not only have you been asleep for decades, but you are also the last surviving member of the probe’s crew.",2014-08-05 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,90.0000,1,85.6247,9

30870,21324,Star Realms,"Many centuries ago the human race began to colonize worlds other than Earth. An exploding population combined with an international hunger for the untapped resources of new worlds led to mankind’s rapid expansion beyond Earth’s solar system and out into the rest of the galaxy. The desirability of potential colony worlds varied widely based on location, natural resources, atmosphere, size, etc. Not surprisingly, this led to tensions and even outright conflict between interested parties, whether they were nations, corporations or other organizations. This led to the militarization of human space. Given the great distances involved and evolving political landscapes and interests, many colonial governments changed. Some shifted allegiances based on common cause or common interest, while many formed independent governments. Of course the driving forces behind most of these changes were the same as ever: money and safety. Those with enough money formed organized space navies; initially this was for protection and influence over each other. Then the Blobs came.  It’s not clear what first drew the hostile attention of these mysterious aliens, but most historians agree that it was in some way triggered by the non-stop expansion of human space, presumably towards Blob territory. While little was known about the organization and political structure of the Blobs at the time, they clearly had a united purpose as regarded humanity. Unfortunately for humanity, they were unprepared to present a united front against a major outside threat like the Blobs.  First contact with the Blobs came in the form of several of humanity’s outer colonies being completely obliterated by fleets of mysterious organic looking ships armed with weaponry that was far superior to that of the fledging regional human space navies. As various colony worlds and political entities sought protection and aid from their more powerful and better equipped trade partners in the human core worlds, they were disappointed with the response. The great distances involved, long standing political differences and short sighted corporate greed resulted in little support from the core worlds, which were now ruled by a single corporate empire, which was more focused on profits than on human lives. Indeed, news of the alien threat caused further escalation and expansion of the core worlds’ space military, but little to none of it was sent to the aid of the outer worlds that were under the greatest threat of Blob attack.  It was about this time that history saw the rise of a planetary administrator turned warlord, Pierre Martine. Martine had already organized one of the biggest and most modernized space navies in the outer colonies, but his rise to power spiked dramatically with the arrival of the Blob menace. Now smaller colonies became quick to swear allegiance to Martine in return for a unified defense from the Blobs. While independent outer colonies continued to get wiped out by the silent and brutal Blobs, the worlds protected by fleets of Martine’s rapidly expanding space navy were largely avoided by the dreaded alien ships. This only added to the rush to swear allegiance to Martine and his rapidly expanding empire. Soon over a third of human space was under his “protection”, which he formalized into the “Star Empire” with the announcement of his assuming the title of Emperor Martine. In just a few decades, Martine had become the sole ruler of far more territory and subjects than anyone in human history.  The Star Empire continued as a united empire under his oldest son, Lucien. Pierre Martine was a brilliant administrator and strategist as well as a long term thinker. He balanced the needs of the various worlds under his control, while at the same time ensuring his planetary governors all understood they owed him their complete loyalty and fealty. He raised Lucien with an understanding of the principles and strategy needed to keep the empire intact and even thriving, if not continuing to expand. Rather than waiting for his death to leave the question of leadership in doubt, Pierre chose to retire when he felt Lucien was ready to rule, thus providing a smooth transition. While the outer worlds of humanity all came to be ruled by a single individual, the government of the core worlds was quite different. What started out as an alliance of nations from Earth trying to colonize into space, quickly became replaced by an alliance of wealthy corporations, as nations became unable to finance the rapid expansion out into the galaxy. In space the naval and economic might of corporations quickly dwarfed and then replaced that of the former Earth-based political entities. Without a political entity powerful enough to stop mergers and monopolies in space, these corporations eventually formed a united corporate empire that controlled the majority of human space. This was called the Trade Federation.  For many decades human historians viewed the galaxy as being completely divided up between these three groups: the Blobs, the Star Empire and the Trade Federation. What they didn’t realize was that there was a fourth major force gathering power in the galaxy: the Machine Cult. The Machine Cult started as an alliance between two major mining and manufacturing colonies that had been cut off from the rest of human space when the Blobs began hostilities with humanity. No human researchers know for certain why these two colonies survived initially, when similar colonies were being eradicated by the Blobs, but the colonists didn’t wait around hoping for their luck to hold. The head of the industrial workers union on the two allied colonies, Thor Bowerson, led a movement that preached that they were a chosen people due to their survival. He preached that they had been abandoned by the rest of humanity and that they had no choice by to embrace their industry if they hoped to survive on their own, cut off from the rest of the known universe.  As fear of the Blobs and resentment of their colonies’ seeming abandonment by the rest of humanity spiraled, Bowerson’s “Machine Cult” took power in a near bloodless coup. The focus of Bowerson’s movement became building a highly mechanized space navy of a size that far exceeded the size of a traditional space navy that their population would normally have been able to support. Thanks to the massive quantities of mineral resources and manufacturing on these two colonies, this turned out to be more achievable than any so called “experts” from the rest of human space would have anticipated.  As they pushed to quickly build up their navy, they began to suffer sporadic Blob attacks. This environment of threat and desperation helped lead to a culture of military focus and of dedication to the goals of the cult. The Cult preached survival through technology, which eventually led to worship of technology itself. Over time, the Machine Cult expanded to other nearby worlds and the reasons for starting the cult faded, while dedication and fervor for its ideals increased.  In recent years the Machine Cult has come into contact with the rest of humanity, but shown no interest in becoming a member of either the Trade Federation or the Star Empire, despite pressure from both of those parties to do so. While they lag behind the other major star realms in population, the Machine Cult makes up for it with a technologically advanced, relatively large and largely automated space navy, as well as with their religious and military zeal.  Given the success of the Machine Cult and The Star Empire with breaking free from the Trade Federation and creating their own independent political entities in spite of and in part because of The Blobs, sometimes others are tempted to try and carve out their own star realms on the outer edges of settled space. This is usually only possible with the cooperation of or at least the tolerance of one or more of the existing factions. As trade intensifies and colonists and settlers are enticed away from the existing star realms, friction inevitably happens, sometimes with the four main star realms and always with other new, competing, emergent realms. War soon follows. So far no new star realms have emerged successfully since the Machine Cult, but that doesn’t stop people from trying. Even various factions from within Blob space have been known to throw their lot in with humans seeking a new start and a new realm. Space is vast, but good colony worlds and worlds with good natural resources are at a premium.  This is your opportunity to try and form a coalition of space farers trying to establish your own new star realm. Another emerging star realm has its eyes on the same territory as you do though. Now you must quickly trade for the ships and bases you need to fight for the very existence of your star realm. Will you succeed in this all-or-nothing space race and emerge the victor?",2014-08-13 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,90.0000,1,70.0000,3

37913,4115,Syphon Filter,"Gabriel Logan and Lian Xing are operatives of The Agency, on the trail of Erich Rhoemer, an international terrorist. In August of 1999, Agent Ellis attempted to infiltrate Rhoemer's narcotics operation in Guácimo, Costa Rica, but was discovered and executed by ex-KGB agent Mara Aramov. Rhoemer then ordered Anton Girdeux, a French mercenary, to burn down the plantation to hide the evidence of their Syphon Filter research.  In Washington, D.C., Edward Benton, the Agency Deputy Director, is briefing Logan's mission to Agency Director Thomas Markinson and a shadowy, unnamed figure. Several weeks later, Gabe and Lian investigate a mysterious viral outbreak in the Himalayas, which leaves only a single survivor. (Lian describes this as impossible.)  The game begins one month after the events in Costa Rica. Rhoemer and his terrorists have launched an assault on Washington, D.C. Gabe defeats Pavel Kravitch, Rhoemer's communications expert, which allows him to gain entry to the Washington Metro. Once inside, an explosive goes off leaving Gabe trapped underground. He pursues Aramov, catching her in the tunnels before heading to a nearby park to aid in the defusing of several viral bombs, where he learns that Aramov has escaped custody. Making his way to the Freedom Memorial, Gabe takes on and defeats Jorge Marcos, Rhoemer's trigger man, before he incinerates Girdeaux.  Lab results show that Syphon Filter is a deadly next-generation biological weapon, capable of targeting specific demographics. Jonathan Phagan, PHARCOM's CEO and founder, attends a gala at his new Expo Center Museum in New York City, where he is taken captive by Aramov and Benton is revealed as a double agent. Gabe kills Benton and frees Phagan, but Aramov, who is captured, again escapes custody.  Gabe goes to Rhoemer's secret base in Rozova, Kazakhstan. He kills Rhoemer's commander Vladislav Gabrek and destroys the base, but Lian is taken captive and presumably killed by Rhoemer.  Gabe is then sent to infiltrate Rhoemer's stronghold in Uzhhorod, Ukraine, which is an abandoned cathedral. Injecting viral patients with what he is convinced is an antidote, Gabe descends deeper into the cathedral to rescue Lian; who explains that there is no 'global' antidote for the virus. They also find Phagan, who is later killed by Aramov. She decides to help Gabe and Lian, since she has nowhere else to go.  Gabe then infiltrates the PHARCOM warehouses in Almaty, Kazakhstan, where PHARCOM security is battling Rhoemer's men. Gabe learns that Markinson, who had been secretly negotiating with Rhoemer to obtain Syphon Filter for the Agency, had made Gabe inject the patients with potassium chloride. Rhoemer reveals he has captured a Soviet-era nuclear ICBM. Rhoemer shoots Markinson and starts the launch sequence for the missile. Gabe cannot prevent it from launching, so his only hope is to initiate its self-destruct sequence once it is in the upper atmosphere. Gabe successfully destroys the missile. Rhoemer, furious at Logan's interference, engages him in a final showdown. Gabe is able to kill him and avert World War III.  In a post-credits scene, the shadowy figure from the beginning of the game is holding a sample of Syphon Filter inside the Agency's headquarters with Aramov, who is laughing.",1999-02-17 00:00:00.000,26,NULL,90.0000,1,78.5114,75

Gorbachev is a reformer who wants to create a new era of peace and co-operation with the Western World. He uses terms like ""Glasnost"" and ""Perestroika"" - modernist policies which involve a re-structuring of the Soviet state and a move away from the old threats of the Cold War. Gorbachev's appointment causes immediate tensions; many of the Communist's old guard, from Generals to Regional Politicians, refuse to accept him and chaos ensues. After a few days the central government manages to control the situation and the country falls into an uneasy truce with itself. But in some outlying areas, often controlled by powerful men with their own agendas, the situation remains dangerously unclear and the Soviet Government loses any real sense of power.  One such area is the Malden Islands group: Everon, a peaceful independent republic, Malden itself, another independent state which contains an important NATO strategic base, and Kolguyev, a Soviet outpost controlled by General Aleksei Guba - an old-school Communist general who firmly believes in the harshest of Cold War policies. Guba has set himself up as a feudal warlord and refuses to listen to any orders from Moscow. The island has become a staging post for his well-equipped modern army to attempt to control the surrounding area and he starts a dangerous adventure of his own with the invasion of Everon. Worst still: Guba controls an unknown number of nuclear weapons. The new Soviet government is unable to do anything about this flashpoint at the moment and US president Reagan meets the new Soviet leader Gorbachev, with the expected outcome of the meeting being an agreement for an international NATO force to go out to the region to try to help to keep the peace.",2001-06-22 00:00:00.000,19,NULL,90.0000,1,88.4480,43

Deathborn catches up to him and gives him one more chance to succeed but says it's the only other chance he'll get.  F-Zero GX's story mode continues with Falcon training for the Grand Prix, followed by racing his rival, Samurai Goroh, in a desert canyon and being forced to enter the bet race under the disguise of 'Famicom' (a reference to Nintendo's first home console). After winning said bet race, Falcon notices Black Shadow attacking the Lightning area on the news. Falcon makes his way to stop him, but is delayed by a group of thugs lead by Michael Chain. After dealing with Chain's gang, Falcon enters a facility to save Jody Summer. His escape is a close one as the core was set to overload and detonate, with said facility going into lock-down procedures. With Jody out of harm's way, he confronts Black Shadow. The evil overlord, with the help of Blood Falcon, binds Falcon and traps him inside his vehicle, strapping a bomb to the Blue Falcon that will detonate if the Blue Falcon goes too slowly. Falcon managed to survive, by driving the vehicle straight off an unfinished road and right under a crane, knocking the bomb off.  Falcon later attended the Grand Prix, where he emerged victorious. After receiving the champion's belt, he witnessed Black Shadow being punished by his master, Deathborn, for his incompetence. Deathborn challenges Falcon to a one-on-one race for ownership of both belts. Before said race occurs, Deathborn reveals his plan to take over the universe, revealing the energies of light and dark are condensed in each belt, and that when combined, provide ultimate power that will turn him into a god-like being, able to lay waste Falcon's galaxy in an instant. Falcon swears to take him down. Falcon stays true to his word, and Deathborn apparently dies. Both belts unite into one, and Falcon vows to keep winning so he can protect the belt from the forces of evil.  At his garage, Falcon is greeted by the creators. Falcon figures out the creators were behind everything, though they do not elaborate their motives. They challenge Falcon to a race, where, if they win, will rip out Falcon's soul and turn it into their creation, implying that he would replace Deathborn. Falcon defeats even them. Screaming, the creators disappear, though whether they actually die or decide to let Falcon go, honoring (but no less angered by) his victory is unclear. Falcon then removes his helmet and leaves the room, where the credits and an exclusive theme song begins to play. (The camera pans at a downward angle, so Falcon's face is not clearly visible. Only a portion of his head in the back is partially seen.)",2003-07-25 00:00:00.000,10,NULL,90.0000,3,78.0258,44

Each time a location is visited, it is done so in a different time period. Spanning from 26 BC to 2000 AD. Almost half of which take place in the 20th century. Each different era and character offers a different periodic and personal perspective on the location.  The chapters found in the game are not discovered in chronological order. Instead, to make the narrative more dramatic, each chapter jumps around the timeline of the plot. However, despite the overall story skipping back and forth through time, the chapters do follow chronological order within their respective locations. This is because each setting also has its own contained story.  In 2000 AD, Alexandra Roivas finds herself returning to her family's estate in Rhode Island after her grandfather, Edward Roivas, her only living relative, is found brutally murdered. Two weeks after returning, with the local police having gotten nowhere with the investigation, Alex decides to investigate the mansion for clues, and stumbles upon a secret room containing a book bound with human skin called the Tome of Eternal Darkness.

A large purse of prize money which was to be awarded to the fighter who could defeat Heihachi Mishima in the final round provided incentive for warriors from all over the globe.  Financed and sponsored by the giant financial groups, the Mishima Zaibatsu, the first Tekken tournament began with eight fighters, all of whom had emerged victorious in death matches held all over the world, all motivated by different motives, all possessing the skill and power to crumble mountains.  Many battles were fought. But only one lone warrior emerged with the right to challenge Heihachi Mishima for the title of King of the Iron Fist.  This warrior was Kazuya Mishima, Heihachi's cold blooded son. Bearing the scar given to him by Heihachi, he enters into vicious combat with his father on the same field where Heihachi last struck down his own son and dropped him into a trench at age five.  After a grueling battle which raged on for hours, Kazuya emerged victorious by utilizing the skills which had been passed down from generation to generation of the Mishima clan.  As Heihachi's broken body lay on the ground, Kazuya dropped to his knees and slowly lifted his father into his arms. Walked slowly to the edge of the same cliff where his father had left him to die, stared out over the landscape of all that was now his, and let go of his father's body.

The Mishima Zaibatsu under Kazuya's leadership has become even more powerful with its tendrils reaching to all corners of the world.

110267,11610,Disgaea: Hour of Darkness,"The story of Disgaea opens with Laharl rising out of an open coffin in his room. Etna, one of the castle vassals, is standing next to him, surrounded by various weapons. She explains that he has been sleeping for two years, far longer than he intended, and his father, King Krichevskoy, has died. Laharl vows to reclaim the throne, and, after consulting with Etna and his other vassals, goes to Vyers' castle.    After defeating the demon Vyers, who refers to himself as the ""Dark Adonis"" and is renamed ""Mid-Boss"" by Laharl, he meets Angel Trainee Flonne. Flonne had been sent to the Netherworld by Seraph Lamington, the ruler of Celestia, to assassinate King Krichevskoy (who was already dead). Shocked by Laharl's lack of grief at his father's death, the eternally optimistic Flonne joins Laharl's party to determine if demons are capable of feeling love. Observing them in secret is the paranoid Archangel Vulcanus, who interprets Flonne's actions as treason and is convinced that she is plotting against him.    After Etna demands that Laharl pay the salary of the Prinnies that she has hired, he decides to attack the demon with the most money in the vicinity. This is Hoggmeiser at Dinero Palace. After defeating Hoggmeiser, Laharl is about to kill him, until Hoggmeiser's son rushes out and gets in the way. Flonne convinces Laharl to spare them, and Laharl lets them keep some of the money. In response to this act, Hoggmeiser joins the party.    At one point, Flonne and Etna discover a photograph of Laharl in an embarrassing situation. Laharl refers to this as a ""paparazzi shot"", however, the actual contents of the photo are never actually revealed. A threat on the back of the photograph states that copies of it would be distributed if Laharl did not accept a challenge to fight for the overlordship; thus Laharl was blackmailed.    Responding to this challenge, Laharl meets Maderas, a vampire. He was banished by King Krichevskoy, for stealing the King's favorite snack, black pretzels. Maderas takes advantage of Laharl's two biggest weaknesses – optimism and women with sexy bodies. Maderas was also controlling Etna by holding her memory. He had instructed her to kill the prince, but she had put him to sleep for two years by poisoning him instead. Etna eventually betrays Maderas, and along with Laharl, Flonne, and Mid-Boss, defeats him.    Waking up later at night, Flonne discovers that several Prinnies are chanting and leaving the castle. Laharl, worried that his reputation will be tarnished if it is discovered that he let his vassals escape, chases after them the next morning. Eventually, he runs into Death, and the player learns that Big Sis Prinny is actually Laharl's mother; she became a Prinny because she gave her life to save him.",2003-01-30 00:00:00.000,19,NULL,90.0000,2,85.0916,25
111287,1346,Xenogears,"Full Story, spoils everything:  ""In the beginning, Deus was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.  The creation of an unknown spacefaring civilization, Deus was originally intended to serve as a biological weapon. To power Deus, an entity known as the Wave Existance is summoned from another dimension and trapped inside Deus's engine, Zohar. However, its creators deem Deus too powerful to use, and they attempt to dispose of it by shipping it away on a spaceship called the Eldridge.  Deus, being a sentient organism, discovers the plan to eliminate it and attacks the Eldridge in transit. After much gratuitous usage of the word ""evacuate"", the Eldrige crashes on a nearby planet. The sole survivor of the crash is a young boy -- the first incarnation of Fei -- who was left crying for his mother.  Although its physical form was trapped inside Zohar, the Wave Existance is able to instill its power in the boy, who had looked upon it during the attack, in an effort to destroy Deus and free itself. The Wave Existance than creates a woman -- Elly -- in the image of Fei's mother and gave her its will.  In order to defend itself, Deus used part of itself to create the first humans -- Cain, the Gazel, and Miang. Miang possesses the Ouroborous (or Urobulos according to Professor Daravon ^_^) Gene, which is passed on to all the women in the world, as they were all descended from her. This gene allowed any woman to become Miang, thus guaranteeing her immortatilty.  The next time we see Fei and Elly, they are in their second incarnation (the Wave Existance keeps reincarnated them); Fei is called Abel, and Elly is Elly as always. They are running from Cain, who kills Elly.  Fei and Elly's third incarnation occurs in the Zeboim civilization (which I think is supposed to be present-day Earth). Here, people live in flying cities above the ground and fight with giant robots called Gears, which use the energy emitted from Zohar to function. However, genetic flaws have rendered many people, including Elly, unable to have children. Kim (Fei), who seems to be a scientist, creates an articial human with self-healing nanomachines, whom he names Emeralda. Just then, guards burst in and kill Elly, and presumably Kim as well.  When the fourth incarnation rolls around, only one flying city remains from the collapsed Zeboim civilization: Solaris, ruled by Emperor Cain and the Gazel Ministry. Solaris rules the world below, but a band of rebels, including Lacan (Fei's fourth incarnation), Sophia/Elly (her real name seems to be Elly, but she is known as Sophia in Nisan), Krelian, and Roni and Rene Fatima are fighting against them.  The land-dwellers are aided by Shevat, a new flying city being constructed atop the Tower of Babel (which is also part of the Ft. Jasper weapons system) under the supervision of Queen Zephyr. Shevat is also home to three Gurus -- Gaspar, Taura Melchior, and Balthasar. Taura teaches Krelian about nanotechnology.  Shevat, however, decides to reveal the position of the rebels to Solaris in exchange for their own safety. Solaris promptly attacks the rebel camp in Nisan, catching the troops off guard. To defend her people, Sophia/Elly sends her ship on a suicide run at the Gebler forces. Her comrades escape, but Krelian goes postal and runs off saying that if there must be no god and he will create god himself. Lacan also goes berserk, and is transformed by the Wave Existance into two parts -- his body becomes Grahf, while his soul is passed on to the next incarnation.  Soon thereafter, a bunch of mysterious monsters called the Diabolos appear and attack the world. Solaris and the land-dwellers call a temporary truce to their fighting to fight the Diabolos. With the power of the Omnigears, such as Roni's Andvari, the humans win. During the conflict, however, the Gazel are killed, and their personalities are stored in the data banks of Solaris's SOL-9000 computer.  In the aftermath of the war, Solaris sets up the -Ethos-, a faux religion with which they control the earth-dwellers, and begins using its Soylent System to turn the test subjects of its genetic experiments into food products or Wels. A special drug, the Limiter, is placed in the food, which renders those who consume it -- all the land-dwellers -- unable to resist Solaris.  As the loser of the war, Shevat goes into hiding by concealing itself behind its Gate. Roni and Rene found Aveh, and Kiselv is also founded by some other guy (we don't know who). Meanwhile, Krelian has joined Solaris to pursue his mission of resurrecting Deus.  Several hundred years later, things have changed little. Solaris has been manipulating a war between Aveh and Kislev on the surface to prevent the earth-dwellers from gaining in power. Krelian, who is pulling all the strings in Solaris, attempts to create a Contact for the Wave Existance. He genetically engineers a clone of Cain that features all the best traits of humanity -- Ramsus -- in hopes that he will be able to contact the Wave Existance. He soon discovers that Ramsus is not needed, as the real Contact has been born to Wong Khan and Karen, agents of Shevat.  Miang takes over the body of Wong Karen and begins subjecting Fei to psychological tests to determine if he is really the Contact. Time again and time again Fei destroys the Solaris researchers who try to probe his mind.  Grahf, who has gone through several bodies in his quest for destruction, hears of Fei's birth and journeys to the Wongs' home in Lahan in order to claim the body of the new incarnation of Lacan. He uses his powers to draw out Fei's inner power, and he (Fei) unleashes a blast of energy that kills Karen. Grahf then spirits the 'awakened' Fei away and makes him his right-hand man.  Meanwhile, in Aveh, the Fatima Dynasty is overthrown by Shakhan, an Ethos bishop who has the backing of Solaris behind him. King Edbart is killed, but his sons Bart and Sigurd, and retainer Maison, escape in the Yggdrasil, the Aveh flagship, and go to live in Nisan. Solaris sends General Vanderkaum to control the Gebler forces.  Sigurd, however, is abducted by Solaris and forced to join Jugend, their military academy. He eventually joins the Elements force, along with Hyuga Ricdeau (Citan), Miang (in yet another new body), and Jessiah Black. Hyuga/Citan and Sigurd are both supporters of Ramsus's rebellion against the Solaris class system.  Ramsus is called into action when Grahf and Id attack Elru on the surface. Id single-handedly trashes Ramsus's Gear battalion, and the entire country is destroyed. The only survivor is Dominia, who joins with Solaris and later becomes part of the Elements after Jessiah quits to live on the surface with his wife Racquel.  Wong Khan catches up with Id and Grahf and somehow seals the Id part of Fei's personality inside and constructs a new persona over it. This persona, the Coward, refuses to acknowledge what he has done, however, and creates a third persona -- the ""normal"" Fei -- to deal with his problems while the Coward relives the memories of his childhood. Meanwhile, Grahf takes over Khan's body, but his control is incomplete -- during lapses of Grahf's control, Khan returns to his normal self, and, during one of these periods, he brings Fei to Lahan Village and leaves him there in the care of Chief Lee.  Sigurd regains his memories of his life on the surface and escapes Solaris to return to aid Bart. He, Maison, and Hans the penguin use the Yggdrasil to prey on Aveh and Kislev troops, thereby keeping either side from becoming too strong and keeping the balance of power.  Also defecting from Solaris is Nikolai Balthasar, son of Shevat's Balthazar. He attempts to flee to Shevat after finding out what Krelian had planned for his Gear research (Deus's revival), but is killed in the attempt and has his mind implanted into the Achtzehn Gear. His daughter Maria manages to escape in the Achtzehn's sister Gear, Siebzehn.  Citan remains behind in Solaris, but is later send to the surface by Cain on a mission to spy on Fei and determine whether he poses a danger.  While not in Khan mode, Grahf is scheming to get Fei back under his control. He has the Kaiser of Kislev manufacture a Gear to his specifications, then arranges for a Gebler force from Aveh to steal it and land in Lahan. A battle ensues, during which Fei hops on board the Weltall, as planned, and uses Id's power to destroy Lahan.  Forced out of the village by the survivors, Fei journeys south through the Blackmoon Forest, where he meets the fifth incarnation of Elly, a Gebler officer and the leader of the group that attacked Lahan. After Fei ""saves"" her from some really wimpy monsters that she could have beaten on her own, she travels with Fei for a short while. That evening, Citan shows up and recommends that Elly leave and return to her family in Solaris. She reluctantly agree.  Citan and Fei are hunting for parts for the damaged Weltall when they are captured by an Aveh transport that was seeking the Weltall. The transport is in turn attacked by the Yggdrasil, and Fei and Citan are brought aboard. They agree to help Bart in his mission to rescue Margie, who has been captured by Shakhan.  The trio frees Margie (and Chu-Chu ^_^) from Fatima Castle and escapes back to Nisan to plan their next move. Meanwhile, Ramsus is appointed head of the Gebler forces, and Vanderkaum is demoted to border patrol.  To overthrow Shakhan, Bart and Citan sneak into the castle, while Fei causes a distraction at the Kislev border. Shakhan sees through their plan and surrounds Bart's team, and they are saved only when Maison rescues them in Citan's Land Crab. Fei meets with more success, as he destroys the Gebler flagship Kefeinzel and Vanderkaum's Gear, the Dora. Grahf then shows up and gives Vanderkaum ""the power"", forcing Fei to transform into Id. Id then annihilates Vanderkaum, Bart's troops, and the Yggdrasil, and severely damages Ramsus's Gear. Citan evacuates the Yggdrasil as it goes down and heads to Nortune to find Fei.  Fei is picked up by some Kislev soldiers and, at Miang's request, is transferred to the prison block of Nortune, the capital of Kislev. Grahf also has the Battling committee actively recruit Fei, and then arranges for the Weltall to be given to him when he enters. Little does Fei know that the Weltall has been rigged to overheat during the match, thus putting Fei out of comission. While unconscious, he changes into Id and kills Rico's men, believing them to be responsible.  After Fei wakes up, he is confronted by Rico, who informs that he is being held responsible for the death of the sewer guards. Rico, Fei, and Citan go to the sewers to investigate and fight and kill a monster called Redrum (actually one of the Wels), thus ""solving"" the mystery. Rico's arm is wounded during the battle with Redrum, however, thus allowing Fei to defeat him in the Battling tournament and become the new Battling champion.  Meanwhile, the Ethos is plotting to eliminate Kaiser Sigmund, as he has been acting too independtly from Solaris. They rig Rico's Gear to go berserk and attack the Kaiser's box, but the Kaiser narrowly escapes death. For this incident, Rico is sentenced to be executed, but he ends up being rescued by Fei, Citan, and Hammer.  Growing desperate, the Gazel order the entire city bombed into oblivion. The Elements and Elly's Gebler squadron are assigned to carry out the mission, but Elly defects to Fei's side and aids him and Rico in directing the Hecht off course. Grahf shows up at the last minute to save Elly.  Back in Aveh, Bart and co. miraculously survive the sinking of the Yggdrasil when they end up in an underground cave containing another Yggdrasil, dating back to Roni's era. This one is designed for sea travel, so Bart's band hits the seas and shoots down Kislev's new Goliath airship on its way to Aveh... only to discover that it was actually Fei and his friends, trying to escape from Kislev in the stolen plane.  Fei and Elly are rescued by the Thames, a floating town commanded by the ""Man of the Sea"". The Thames is currently working for the -Ethos-, which is trying to excavate some Zeboim ruins in order to acquire technology that would allow them to break away from Solaris.  Bart shows up in the Yggdrasil and apologizes for shooting down the Goliath. After a number of failed attacks by Solaris, Ramsus eventually manages to succeed in injuring Fei in combat. Seeing that Fei's wounds require medical attention, the party seeks the help of the healers at the Ethos. While still on the Thames, they meet Billy Lee Black, a priest/exorcist from the -Ethos-, when they save his sister Primera. Billy agrees to help Fei, so they take him to the -Ethos- Headquarters, elsewhere in Aquvy, and have him treated by the doctors there. He is promptly released and taken back to the Yggdrasil sick bay.  In gratitude for Billy's help, the party agrees to accompany him on a mission to destroy a Solaris ship infested with Wels mutants. The mission is a success, but when Billy returns to the Ethos HQ, he finds everyone dead. The attack is the work of his mentor Bishop Stone, who killed all those who were attempting to break away from Solaris. Stone escapes in his Alkanshel (I think that's supposed to be ""Archangel"") Gear to attack the Thames.  During the battle, the Alkanshel is joined by a black ""fishbowl"" device (I believe it's the Soylent System) that drops out Wels. The Thames manages to fend off the attack, but not without being damaged. Citan and the gang follow the ""fishbowl"" to a supposedly-abandoned Solaris dig site, where they discover Emeralda, still left in the tube that she had been created in 4000 years ago. But before they can free her, Stone arrives and captures her, so that Krelian can use her in his nanotechnology experiments. While the party is pursuing Stone out of the dig site, Fei suddenly shows up in Id form and demands that Stone release his daughter. Stone escapes, and suddenly Khan/Wiseman shows up to hold off Id while the party escapes.  Back on the Yggdrasil, Fei turns up at the Gear Dock at loss as to what happened to him. Then Stone, now merged with his Gear, attacks, but Billy and Jessie team up to put him out of commission. The party then goes to Shevat to ally with Solaris's rival. There they meet Maria and Queen Zephyr. Meanwhile, Dominia sneaks into the city and shuts off the shield generators, allowing Solaris to attack.  Fei and friends fend off the initial assault, but then the Achtzehn arrives and uses its Psycho Jammer to freeze the Gears. Enter Chu-Chu, who uses her ""Churansformation"" to assume the size of a Gear and fend off the Achtzehn. Nikolai then transfers his consciousness from Achtzehn to Siebzehn, and has Maria destroy Achtzehn.  Back on the surface, Shakhan's forces invade Nisan. Bart rushes to Nisan and enters the underground Ft. Jasper, where he discovers Roni's Andvari Omnigear. As Ft. Jasper is raised from the ground, Shakhan attacks it, but is forced to retreat. Bart chases Shakhan to a cave and finishes him off, also destroying one of Solaris's Gate generators in the process. Meanwhile, Bart's soldiers retake the capital, and Bart assumes the throne.  To destroy the second Gate, Billy fires a beam from the recently-excavated Ft. Jasper. It bounces off the lens on Babel Tower, designed for just that purpose, and demolishes the Gate under the -Ethos- HQ. The last Gate lies underwater at Sargasso Point, so Fei and co. dive down to destroy it. Along the way, they encounter Emeralda, who is under Krelian's control. After destroying the Gate, they convince Emeralda to come back with them to the Yggdrasil.  With all three Gates destroyed, Solaris appears in the sky. Fei and Elly sneak into the capital district, and after being chased by some Security Cubes, make their way to Elly's house. They attempt to use Elly's father's computer, but are caught by Erich. To Fei's surprise, Erich lets him go and tells him to follow his own path.  Elly stays behind at her house, but soon some Solaris soldiers arrive and demand that her parents turn over Elly for her traitorous acts. Erich stalls the soldiers while Elly escapes. She catches Fei and Citan on their way into the palace via a dust chute.  In the palace, Elly confronts Citan with the accumulated evidence that he is working for Solaris. Before Citan can reply, the lights go out. In the dark, Fei stumbles into the SOL-9000, and is captured. Meanwhile, Citan frees Elly and the rest of the party, who was captured earlier, and removes their Limiters. Hammer is confronted by Krelian, who threatens to mutate him unless he carries out his orders: To capture Elly, whom Krelian needs to resurrect Deus.  Hammer is forced to comply, and while the party is making their escape with Elly's parents, he suddenly points a gun at Elly. Medena forces her way into the path of the gun and advances on Hammer. Hammer panics, shoots her, and runs off. Just then, Grahf and Miang show up and kill Erich in an effort to 'awaken' Elly. They meet with no success, but Fei is 'awakened' and turns into Id. He then destroys Solaris completely, though all of the major villains escape.  Shevat insists on carbon-freezing Fei to prevent him from using his Id power again, but Elly frees him. They fly away in Weltall, but Ramsus arrives. Since he last fought Fei, Ramsus has learned that he was an artificial Contact created and was ""discarded"" once Fei was discovered, and now is obsessed killing him. Using his new Omnigear, he shoots down Weltall.  After their crash landing, Fei and Elly are nursed back to health by Taura Melchior, who lives in seclusion on the surface. Elly, Citan, and Emeralda fire the Limiter cure out of a cannon to spread it across the world, while Fei hurries off to Kislev to stop a last-ditch attack by Solaris. He and Bart combine the Imperial District with the Yggdrasil to form a Gear and destroy Solaris's Fort Hurricane.  Krelian activates the Soylent System and starts mutating people into forms in which they will be able to be assimilated by Deus. While the sisters of Nisan try to cure the mutated people, Fei and company destroy the Soylent System and the Sufal Mass, a huge creature formed of amalgamated mutants.  While Fei and co. search for the remaining Anima Relics that they can use to enhance their Gears, Krelian convinces Ramsus to kill Cain -- as a clone of Cain, Ramsus is the only one who can kill him. Krelian also melds Hammer with a Gear and sends him after Fei, but Hammer is killed.  With Cain out of the way, the Gazel are able to use the Gaetia Key to raise the Eldridge from the sea -- and, in turn, Krelian summarily erases them from the data banks, leaving him in command. Fei shows up in the Eldridge to prevent Krelian from locating Deus's shell, but Grahf takes him captive and tries to crucify him. Elly comes to the rescue in her Omnigear and succeeds in rescuing Fei, but then she is captured by Krelian and Grahf.  Krelian begins construction of Merkava, the ""ark of god"", which he will use to return to the dimension the Wave Existance is from. Fei and Ramsus attempt to stop him; Ramsus kills both Krelian and Miang, but Krelian has already merged with Deus, and Miang merely assumes the body of Elly. Enraged, Fei turns into Id again and is once again carbon-frozen.  While Deus starts assimilating the people of the planet, Id breaks out of his prison and destroys Shevat. Citan and the other characters catch up with him on his way to Contact the Wave Existance. With the aid of Khan, Fei eventually resolves all his multiple personalities, then the Wave Existance appears and changes the Weltall into the Xenogears.  Grahf takes over Khan's body again and tries to kill Fei. Then Deus strikes, however, attempting to destroy Fei before Fei does the same to Deus. Grahf/Lacan/Khan sacrifices himself as a decoy Fei, while Fei and his friends return to Merkava to destroy Deus. They succeed in destroying Zohar, the core, thus freeing the Wave Existance. The energy emitted by the Wave Existance threatens to destroy the world, so Elly (now part of Deus) uses her powers to move Deus out into space.  With the destruction of Zohar, all the Gears have stopped working, except Fei's (which has evolved due to his Contact). Fei blasts out into space after Deus and ends up being sucked into some super-duper dimension, where he must battle the Ouroborous gene itself to return Elly to normal. He succeeds in rescuing Elly, and he and Elly return to the planet as Krelian dies. The end.""",1998-02-11 00:00:00.000,30,NULL,90.0000,2,88.6739,75

Thousands of years prior to the present time of the game, the civilizations, one of which existed for each moon, developed technologically to the point where each created a Gigas, a colossal living weapon of mass destruction, controlled by a Moon Crystal. Using the Gigas, the civilizations warred with one another, threatening the extinction of humanity. The most advanced, the Silver Civilization, used their Gigas to summon the Rains of Destruction, which pulled meteors from the orbiting moons and crashed them down onto the planet's surface. The catastrophic destruction stopped the rampage of the Gigas, as well as nearly destroyed the other five civilizations, thus ending the war. A seal was placed on the Silver Gigas to prevent it from being used again, and the Moon Crystals were hidden away, while each civilization worked on rebuilding itself.    Vyse and Aika are members of the Blue Rogues, a faction of Robin Hood-minded air pirates gathered together to resist the militant and tyrannical Valuan Empire.

Etna, one of the castle vassals, is standing next to him, surrounded by various weapons. She explains that he has been sleeping for two years, far longer than he intended, and his father, King Krichevskoy, has died. Laharl vows to reclaim the throne, and, after consulting with Etna and his other vassals, goes to Vyers' castle.    After defeating the demon Vyers, who refers to himself as the ""Dark Adonis"" and is renamed ""Mid-Boss"" by Laharl, he meets Angel Trainee Flonne. Flonne had been sent to the Netherworld by Seraph Lamington, the ruler of Celestia, to assassinate King Krichevskoy (who was already dead). Shocked by Laharl's lack of grief at his father's death, the eternally optimistic Flonne joins Laharl's party to determine if demons are capable of feeling love. Observing them in secret is the paranoid Archangel Vulcanus, who interprets Flonne's actions as treason and is convinced that she is plotting against him.    After Etna demands that Laharl pay the salary of the Prinnies that she has hired, he decides to attack the demon with the most money in the vicinity. This is Hoggmeiser at Dinero Palace. After defeating Hoggmeiser, Laharl is about to kill him, until Hoggmeiser's son rushes out and gets in the way. Flonne convinces Laharl to spare them, and Laharl lets them keep some of the money. In response to this act, Hoggmeiser joins the party.    At one point, Flonne and Etna discover a photograph of Laharl in an embarrassing situation. Laharl refers to this as a ""paparazzi shot"", however, the actual contents of the photo are never actually revealed. A threat on the back of the photograph states that copies of it would be distributed if Laharl did not accept a challenge to fight for the overlordship; thus Laharl was blackmailed.    Responding to this challenge, Laharl meets Maderas, a vampire. He was banished by King Krichevskoy, for stealing the King's favorite snack, black pretzels. Maderas takes advantage of Laharl's two biggest weaknesses – optimism and women with sexy bodies. Maderas was also controlling Etna by holding her memory. He had instructed her to kill the prince, but she had put him to sleep for two years by poisoning him instead. Etna eventually betrays Maderas, and along with Laharl, Flonne, and Mid-Boss, defeats him.    Waking up later at night, Flonne discovers that several Prinnies are chanting and leaving the castle. Laharl, worried that his reputation will be tarnished if it is discovered that he let his vassals escape, chases after them the next morning. Eventually, he runs into Death, and the player learns that Big Sis Prinny is actually Laharl's mother; she became a Prinny because she gave her life to save him.",2006-11-30 00:00:00.000,5,NULL,90.0000,2,80.0852,6

158477,9740,Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut,"On the eve of unveiling a new type of augmentation that will negate the use of Neuropozyne, Sarif Industries is attacked by the Tyrants. Adam Jensen attempts to save Megan Reed and her fellow scientists, but Tyrant leader Namir critically wounds him and apparently kills Megan and the scientists. David Sarif uses his most advanced technology to save Adam, giving him superhuman abilities: he also learns that the augmentations are bonding to him naturally without the need for Neuropozyne. Called back to deal with an attack on a Sarif Industries warehouse by anti-augmentation extremists, Adam discovers an augmented hacker attempting to gain access to the secret Typhoon weapon augmentation. Upon discovery, the hacker is forced by their controller to shoot himself. After Adam retrieves the deceased hacker's neural hub from his old Detroit police precinct, Frank Pritchard tracks the hacking signal to an abandoned factory in Highland Park. Adam discovers the Tyrants guarding a FEMA detention camp, but they are moving out after the failure of the Sarif raid. Adam confronts and defeats one of the mercenaries, Barrett, who tells him to go to Hengsha before killing himself with a grenade.    Together with pilot Faridah Malik, Adam travels to Hengsha and tracks down the hacker, Arie van Bruggen, who is being both hunted by private security company Belltower Associates and hidden by local triad leader Tong Si Hung. Van Bruggen directs Adam to find evidence inside Tai Yong Medical, the world's largest augmentation technology manufacturer and Sarif's main rival. Infiltrating Tai Yong, Adam finds footage of a call between Namir and Zhao Yun Ru, which confirms that Megan and the other missing scientists are alive and that Eliza Cassan is somehow involved. Confronting Zhao in her penthouse apartment, he learns that she is allied to a powerful organization that controls global interests before she triggers security and forces him to leave. Traveling to the Picus corporate building in Montreal, Jensen tracks down Eliza, revealed to be an artificial intelligence construct designed to influence the media. Despite her programming, she has begun to question her role and offers to help Adam. After he defeats Tyrant member Fedorova, Eliza gives him footage directing him to Doctor Isaias Sandoval, aide to William Taggart.    Back in Detroit, Sarif admits to Adam that the Illuminati are behind the attacks. Adam infiltrates a Humanity Front rally and discovers Sandoval's location. Sandoval admits his involvement in the kidnapping and gives Adam the lead to find the researchers. Back in Sarif HQ, Adam meets Hugh Darrow, who is currently working to stave off global warming with the newly constructed Panchaea Facility in the Arctic. Adam, along with other augmented people, also start experiencing painful glitches, with authorities urging them to have a biochip replacement. Pritchard locates the tracking beacon of one of the scientists, taking Adam back to Hengsha, where he and Malik are ambushed by Belltower. The beacon leads Adam to Tong Si Hung, who has just been implanted with the now-deceased scientist's arm. Under Tong's direction, Adam manages to stow away in a stasis pod in the wake of a staged explosion, waking up a few days later in a secret Singapore base. He finds the kidnapped scientists, and learns that the biochip malfunctions were staged to distribute the result of their research: a new biochip to control augmented humans. Adam and the scientists stage a distraction, allowing him to infiltrate the facility's secret bunker. Here he faces Namir one last time, then finds Megan. Confronted, Megan tells him that she was kidnapped for her research; the genetic key to make all humans compatible with augmentations, which she found in Adam's DNA — and to help Darrow foil the Illuminati's plans.    Moments later, Darrow appears live on television and broadcasts a modified signal that throws any augmented person with the new biochip into a fear-driven, murderous frenzy. Jensen evacuates the scientists, and commandeers an orbital flight module to reach Panchaea. He confronts Darrow, who reveals that he wants humanity to abandon the augmentation technology he invented, because he believes it will destroy human identity. Adam sets out to disable Panchaea's Hyron Project supercomputer and end the broadcast; on the way, he encounters Taggart and Sarif, who each urge him to side with them and further their own agendas. At the heart of Panchaea, Jensen first confronts Zhao Yun Ru when she tries to hijack the signal for her own use; then Eliza, who offers Jensen four choices. Jensen can either broadcast the full truth and distance humanity from augmentations; rig the broadcast so it throws suspicion on the Humanity Front and allows further development of augmentation technology; send out a report blaming the incident on contaminated Neuropozyne so Taggart's group and by extension the Illuminati find new support; or destroy Panchea, leaving no-one to ""spin the story"". Depending on the choice and whether Jensen has taken a pacifist or violent approach through the game, his final narration varies.    In a post-credits scene, Megan meets with Bob Page, the main antagonist of Deus Ex, to discuss her employment in ""the nanite virus chimera"" and ""D project"": prior to this, Page instructs his cohort Morgan Everett to search the Hyron Project for salvageable technology for the 'Morpheus Initiative': these are the precursors to the creation of the Denton clones, the manufactured nanotechnological ""Gray Death"" virus and the ""Helios"" artificial intelligence, key parts of the plot of Deus Ex.",2013-10-22 00:00:00.000,34,1,89.8333,6,90.9074,96

The introduction shows Jak being captured, while Daxter manages to escape. Almost two years later (having no luck with rescuing Jak), Daxter has forgotten all about finding his friend. An old man named Osmo, whom Daxter meets, hires Daxter as an exterminator working in various parts of Haven City, and occasionally its environs, to exterminate bug-like Metal Heads referred to in-game as 'Metal Bugs'. During his adventures, Daxter meets a mysterious woman named Taryn who, despite being less than impressed by Daxter's interest in her, occasionally helps him.    After completing a number of missions for Osmo, Daxter sees Jak in a Prison Zoomer and attempts to chase after it. After being cornered by some Krimzon Guards (who had noticed Daxter's pursuit), Daxter is rescued by Osmo's son Ximon, who assists him with several more missions including one to Baron Praxis' palace where Daxter steals a map of the Fortress, the prison where Jak is being held. After returning to the extermination shop, an arthropod sidekick that Daxter acquired earlier is killed by Kaeden, a bitter man who seemingly wants to steal Osmo's shop, but, in actuality, is working for Kor, the Metal Head leader.    When Daxter tries to stop Kaeden from escaping the shop, Kaeden suddenly blows up the shop with a bomb he placed in the shop earlier. Daxter and Osmo survive, and Daxter promises to stop Kaeden, but only after he rescues Jak. Daxter infiltrates the Fortress and finds Kaeden, who reveals himself to be a giant Metal Bug. Daxter manages to defeat Kaeden, who tries to warn him that Kor is waiting outside for them, and then uses a hover platform to begin searching for Jak within the Fortress, leading into the opening cutscene from Jak II. After this, the game cuts to a point later in the timeline at Daxter's Naughty Ottsel Bar, where he is recounting the story to Jak, Keira, Samos, Tess and Taryn.",2006-03-14 00:00:00.000,12,NULL,89.5000,3,79.5558,48

145066,500,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"After the Joker assaults Gotham City Hall, he is caught by Batman and taken to Arkham Asylum, which temporarily houses many members of the Joker's gang, who were transferred after a fire at Blackgate Prison. Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.    There, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan—a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength—intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan.    At the Penitentiary, Quinn releases Poison Ivy from her cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production facility in the Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that it can only be made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.    Batman returns to the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the preparations for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Joker—who is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a post-credits scene, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it.",2009-08-25 00:00:00.000,683,NULL,89.4000,8,86.3903,1843

22168,2605,BattleBlock Theater,"Almost all of the game's cut-scenes are done in a stick puppet style. The game begins with the narrator (played by Will Stamper) telling the adventures of the hundreds of friends aboard the S.S. Friendship, as well as Hatty Hattington, who is known as ""best friend to one and all"". After encountering a heavy storm, the S.S. Friendship becomes shipwrecked on a mysterious, seemingly abandoned island, and the crew itself vanishes. Upon waking up from the wreck, the player character seeks shelter from the storm in a dilapidated theater. Soon afterwards, the player discovers technologically advanced, highly-evolved cats restraining a captive Hatty as he is being fitted with an ominously glowing top hat. The hat appears to change him, and he alerts the cats to the player's presence, attacking them and rendering them unconscious. Upon coming to, it is revealed that the entire crew of the S.S. Friendship is being held prisoner by the cats, with Hatty as their apparent new leader. The player is then released from their cell and forced into deadly games by the feline wardens. The cats, who force their prisoners into deadly theater performances, watch with amusement as the player fights for their survival. As the player completes challenges, they find gems which are spend on unlocking fellow crew members to play as in these theater performances. Appearing to be possessed by the hat's unknown powers, Hatty begins working for the cats and against the player. As the player progresses, the narrator reveals more about the theater. Hundreds of years before the player shipwrecked on the island, Purrham Furbottom, a theatrical aficionado, sought to build the world's greatest theater. The opening night saw the most jaw-dropping feats and thrills the likes of which were never seen before, making the theater an overnight success. However, Furbottom did not allow intermissions in the theater, and after an untold amount of time watching the show, he died after ""pooping himself to death on the way to the bathroom."" Since then, his top hat has been passed down to various others, who were each revered by the cats as their leader, and who each met with grim fates of their own. The hat, the narrator theorizes, is haunted by the grief and sorrow of each of its past wearers, and Hatty is its current victim, having sunk into a depression while being surrounded by the many gems the player has accrued, without doing anything to help the state of the theater. Eventually, the cats grow tired of Hatty's inaction, and begin rioting, striking, and more, while the player's challenges grow increasingly difficult. As the theater deteriorates further, the narrator provides encouragement to the player, and continues to shed light on the cats' mental state, which grows more unstable as time progresses. The narrator also instructs the player to enter The Vault, which houses Hatty and all the gems the player has spent, before the cats kill Hatty and the rest of the crew, starting the madness over again. After completing the final set of challenges inside the Vault, the player breaks into Hatty's throne room. Hatty doesn't budge, so the player carries him out of the crumbling theater as the crew of the S.S. Friendship orchestrates a mass breakout. Everyone manages to make it back to the boat amidst the chaos, escaping the island and the cats that reside there. As the player celebrates with hot cocoa, he tries to cheer up Hatty, who the narrator implies has sunk into a catatonic state from prolonged exposure to the hat. The narrator sings a sad song as the credits roll, before quickly recovering and singing a more happy, upbeat song, rocking the boat and flinging Hatty into the sea, where he sinks to the bottom. The hat lands on his head and begins glowing green as opposed to its usual red, and shoots a beam skyward, where it sends the boat flying and continues into space, where it vaporizes a bear that appeared during the narrator's upbeat song. The narrator claims to understand what just happened, but does not explain, sending the game back to the title screen.",2013-04-03 00:00:00.000,27,NULL,89.2857,8,77.0272,131

The Hyperion escapes, but Kerrigan remains behind to locate Raynor, only to hear a Dominion newscast announcing that he has been captured and executed. Enraged, Kerrigan returns to Zerg territory to retake control of the swarm and overthrow the tyrannical Dominion.  On the volcanic planet Char, Kerrigan subdues a renegade brood before attacking the occupying Dominion forces. Kerrigan, in a rage, destroys a Dominion command fortress and kills its commander, General Horace Warfield. After a change of heart, she allows the wounded and the unarmed to evacuate. On the frozen planet Kaldir, she annihilates the local Protoss forces, reclaiming the local brood and evolving the swarm to survive in harsh climate.  Zeratul visits Kerrigan and advises her to regain her powers by traveling to Zerus, the original homeworld of the Zerg. On Zerus, Kerrigan learns that a fallen Xel'Naga named Amon was responsible for making the Zerg what they are: A warring swarm, bound to a single overriding will. Some primal Zerg, however, eluded and remained independent constantly evolving creatures. One such zerg named Zurvan, known as the ""Ancient One"", lies dormant in hibernation and must be awoken by Kerrigan for its knowledge on the origins of the Zerg. Upon awakening, Zurvan advises Kerrigan to seek out a primordial spawning pool to regain her former powers. Kerrigan enters the ancient spawning pool and transforms into a primal Queen of Blades. She kills and absorbs the genetic essences of four powerful hostile primal leaders and Zurvan after it attempts to collect her essence for itself. A primal leader called Dehaka and his pack join her, provided that she gives them essence to collect.  Kerrigan is contacted by a Zerg-infested Alexei Stukov, a former Vice Admiral of the United Earth Directorate who was apparently killed by Duran at Braxis. With Stukov's aid, Kerrigan assaults a research station where Emil Narud, a servant of Amon, is breeding Protoss-Zerg hybrids. After eliminating Dominion facility security forces and Tal'Darim loyal to Narud, Kerrigan confronts Narud in a showdown of power. Morphing first into Raynor and then into Kerrigan's human form, Narud impales Kerrigan before being fatally wounded. Revealing that Amon is revived, he perishes.  Meanwhile, Emperor Arcturus Mengsk contacts Kerrigan and claims Raynor is kept alive and imprisoned, as a bargaining chip against Kerrigan attacking the Dominion throne world of Korhal IV. Kerrigan relays the news to the Hyperion. They plan to hack the Dominion network to locate Raynor, but the only one with such expertise is Colonel Orlan, held captive by Mira Han, a mercenary who refuses to release him. Thus, the Hyperion attacks Mira's mining operations, forcing her to comply. Orlan locates Raynor on a prison ship that constantly changes location. Kerrigan assaults the ship and rescues Raynor, who is revolted by Kerrigan's reversion of form. Although he cannot bring himself to shoot Kerrigan, he tells her that they are done despite her confession that she loves him.  Having united all Zerg under the swarm, Kerrigan launches an invasion of Korhal, concentrating on the capital city of Augustgrad. With the aid of Dehaka and his pack, she destroys Mengsk's Psi Destroyer, a device that hurts the swarm from afar but is ineffective on the primal Zerg. As Kerrigan sends the swarm to assault Mengsk's palace, Crown Prince Valerian urges her to slow down her invasion to minimize civilian losses; she accepts, understanding that Valerian is not like his father. Midway through the final battle, Raynor arrives to assist Kerrigan, much to her surprise. Together, they succeed in breaching the imperial palace. In the confrontation that follows, Mengsk reveals that he has the Xel'Naga artifact in his possession, intending to use it to kill Kerrigan. Before Mengsk can do so Raynor interferes, allowing Kerrigan to impale Mengsk. Kerrigan kills Mengsk by injecting psionic energy causing him to explode.  As the dust settles, Kerrigan thanks Raynor before joining her swarm. With her quest for vengeance completed she renounces everything she once was or had and prepares to face Amon, the enemy of all living things, in a conflict that will not only decide the fate of the Koprulu Sector, but the entire Galaxy.",2013-03-12 00:00:00.000,105,NULL,89.1111,9,86.7182,209
173343,15,Fallout 3,"The introductory sequence introduces the player to their character's father James, a doctor and scientist in Vault 101. James frequently makes comments about the player character's deceased mother Catherine, and her favorite Bible passage, Revelation 21:6, which speaks of ""the waters of life"".  The main quest begins after the player is forced to flee Vault 101 when James leaves the vault, throwing it into anarchy and causing the paranoid Overseer to send his security force after the player. The search for James takes the character on a journey through the Wasteland, first to the nearby town of Megaton, named for the undetonated atomic bomb at the center of town, then the Galaxy News Radio station, whose enthusiastic DJ Three Dog gives the player the moniker of ""The Lone Wanderer"". The player travels to Rivet City, a derelict aircraft carrier now serving as a fortified human settlement. Here the player meets Doctor Li, a scientist who worked alongside the player's father. Doctor Li informs the player of Project Purity, a plan conceived by Catherine and James to purify all the water in the Tidal Basin and eventually the entire Potomac River with a giant water purifier built in the Jefferson Memorial. However, continued delays and Catherine's death during childbirth put an end to the project, and James took the player's character as a newborn to raise them in the safety of Vault 101.  After investigating the Jefferson Memorial, the Lone Wanderer tracks James to Vault 112, and frees him from a virtual reality program being run by the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Braun. James and the player return to Rivet City, and James reveals he sought out Braun for information on the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), a device that contains the components needed to finally activate Project Purity. James and Doctor Li lead a team of Rivet City scientists to the memorial with intent to restart the project, but the memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from the remnants of the pre-War United States government. James floods the project's control room with radiation to stop the Enclave military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it, killing himself (but Autumn survives), his last words urging his child to run. The Lone Wanderer and Dr. Li flee to the ruins of the Pentagon, now a base for the Brotherhood of Steel and now known as the Citadel.  With Project Purity still inoperable even with the Enclave occupying the site, the player travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K. and finish James's work. The player finds the Vault to be a testing site for the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus), and the source of the Super Mutants in the Capital Wasteland. After the player acquires the G.E.C.K., the Wanderer is ambushed by the Enclave and captured.  At the Enclave base at Raven Rock, the player is freed from their cell by the Enclave leader, President John Henry Eden, who requests a private audience with them. En route to his office however, Colonel Autumn defies Eden's orders and takes command of the Enclave military, ordering them to kill the player. Fighting their way to Eden's office, the player discovers Eden is actually a sentient ZAX series supercomputer who took control of the Enclave after their defeat in Fallout 2 on the West Coast thirty years ago. Eden wishes to repeat the plan of then-President Dick Richardson using Project Purity, infecting the water with a modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any mutated life. This plan will kill most life in the wasteland including humans, but the Enclave, due to their genetic ""purity"" as a result of their isolation, will be immune and free to take control of the area. The Wanderer, provided with a sample of the new F.E.V., is given a choice to either leave peacefully or convince Eden to self-destruct the entire base. The Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock and returns to the Citadel.  With the knowledge they possess, the G.E.C.K. and the means to activate Project Purity, the Brotherhood assault the Jefferson Memorial, spearheaded by a giant robot named Liberty Prime. In the control room of Project Purity the player confronts Colonel Autumn, and has the choice to persuade him to give up or kill him. Dr. Li informs the player that the purifier is ready to be activated, but the activation code must be input manually, and also that the control room is flooded with lethal amounts of radiation. The Lone Wanderer is forced to choose between sending Sarah Lyons of the Brotherhood inside the extremely irradiated purifier or entering themselves. Whoever enters into the chamber inputs the code hinted at through the game, that being 21:6, and dies from a radiation spike.",2008-10-28 00:00:00.000,536,1,89.1000,12,83.6007,1244

It's so quiet...”  Shaking off his uneasy premonition, Mario steps into the silent castle, where he is greeted by the gruff words, “No one's home! Now scram! Bwa, ha, ha.”  The sound seems to come from everywhere.  “Who's there?! I've heard that voice somewhere before...”  Mario begins searching all over the castle. Most of the doors are locked, but finding one open, he peeks inside. Hanging on the wall is the largest painting he has ever seen, and from behind the painting comes the strangest sound that he has ever heard...  “I think I hear someone calling. What secrets does this painting hold?”  Without a second thought, Mario jumps at the painting. As he is drawn into it, another world opens before his very eyes.  Once inside the painting, Mario finds himself in the midst of battling Bob-ombs. According to the Bob-omb Buddies, someone...or something...has suddenly attacked the castle and stolen the “Power Stars.” These stars protect the castle. With the stars in his control, the beast plans to take over the Mushroom Castle.  To help him accomplish this, he plans to convert the residents of the painting world into monsters as well. If nothing is done, all those monsters will soon begin to overflow from inside the painting.  “A plan this maniacal, this cunning...this must be the work of Bowser!”  Princess Toadstool and Toad are missing, too. Bowser must have taken them and sealed them inside the painting.

However, as is the case in the original, the final boss of the game still clearly resembles Adolf Hitler, and is referred to as ""The Leader"".    Rearmed centers around two warring factions: the Federation and the Empire. It begins with the Imperial forces discovering classified documents regarding the development of a secret weapon known as the Albatros project, originally started by an organization known as the Badds, but never completed. Killt, Generalissimo of the Empire's forces, decides to complete the project himself. When the Federation learns of the Empire's plot, they send in their national hero, Super Joe to infiltrate the Empire. During his mission, Joe is captured by Imperial forces. The Federation sends in a second operative named Nathan Spencer to rescue Super Joe and assist him in completing his mission.    Spencer traverses several areas, eliminating many Imperial leaders along his way. As he progresses, he finds new technology and travels deeper behind enemy lines. The plot culminates as Super Joe is rescued from the bionic Imperial soldier Gottfried Groeder, and both Spencer and Joe set out to destroy the Albatros project. During the mission, Spencer encounters ""The Leader"", the resurrected head of the Imperial forces. Spencer defeats The Leader, and together with Super Joe destroys the Albatros.

172628,2207,Shadow of the Colossus,"The story of Shadow of the Colossus begins as Wander enters the forbidden land, traveling across the long bridge at its entrance on his horse, Agro. According to Lord Emon later in the game, prior to entering the forbidden land Wander had stolen an ancient sword, which is the only weapon capable of slaying the colossi of the forbidden land. Led to the massive Shrine of Worship at the center of the region, Wander carries with him the body of a maiden named Mono. A moment later, several shadow-like creatures with humanoid forms appear and prepare to attack Wander, but he easily dismisses them with a wave of the ancient sword in his possession, which emits strong beams of light. After vanquishing the shadow creatures, the voice of the disembodied entity known as ""Dormin"" echoes from above, expressing surprise that Wander possesses the weapon. Wander requests that Dormin return Mono's soul to her body, which it states may be possible, but only if the sixteen idols lining the temple's hall are destroyed. It explains that this task can only be accomplished by using the ancient sword to kill sixteen colossi located throughout the land. Each contains a portion of Dormin's own essence, though this is not revealed until late in the game.      Despite a warning from Dormin that he may have to pay a great price to revive Mono, Wander sets out to search the land for the colossi and destroy them. In a sequence after the eighth's slaying, a deterioration of Wander's body is shown clearly—his skin becoming paler, his hair darker, and dark streaks growing across his face. After the death of the twelfth colossus, it is revealed to the player that Wander is being pursued by a group of warriors led by Emon.      Urged to hurry with his task by Dormin, Wander soon heads off to defeat the sixteenth and final colossus. On the way to this confrontation, he travels on horseback across a long bridge, which begins to collapse as he is halfway across. As Agro jumps over the last gap in the bridge, the portion which is landed on begins to separate from its foundation, causing Agro to nearly lose footing. Sensing the impending fall, Agro jerks forward to throw Wander to safety on the other side, making a sacrifice for him and falling into the river hundreds of feet below as the bridge finally gives way. Wander goes on to defeat the final colossus, and Emon's company arrives in the Shrine of Worship just as the last temple idol crumbles; Wander appears soon afterwards, his eyes and skin now both entirely pale, and two small horns protruding from his head. Declaring that Wander has been ""possessed by the dead"", Lord Emon orders his warriors to kill him. While he struggles to reach Mono, one warrior shoots Wander in the leg with a crossbow, while another stabs him through his heart with a sword. Black blood sprays from the wound as Wander's body becomes covered in darkness and falls to the floor—a death identical to those suffered by the colossi.      Afterward, Dormin's spirit possesses Wander's body, transforming it into a shadowy giant. Dormin, now speaking in its masculine voice, explains that it had been separated to sixteen pieces—the colossi—to seal away its power, and that by entering Wander, who absorbed physical form from defeating each colossus, it is now whole again. While his men flee, Lord Emon casts the ancient sword into a small pool at the back of the temple's hall, creating a whirlwind of light that consumes Dormin and Wander. Emon and his men flee the forbidden land as the bridge connecting to the temple collapses behind them. As they safely arrive at the entrance to the forbidden land, Emon expresses hope that if Wander survived, someday he may be able to atone for his crimes.      In the temple, Mono awakens, restored by Dormin in accordance with its agreement with Wander, and Agro limps into the temple with an injured hind leg.

Just when people forgot all about Dr. Wily, robots all over the world began going crazy. It soon became apparent that these robots were those created by Dr. Light. As phone calls came pouring into Light's lab, Dr. Wily interrupted all television programs to announce that these robotic riots were not his doing. He then continued to show video evidence that proved Dr. Light's involvement in the recent violent outbreaks. To make matters worse, Wily gave the account number to his personal bank account and announced that he would accept donations to build his own robot army to counter that of Light's. Mega Man quickly volunteered to clear Light's name and was sent out to investigate the source of the problem.    Before long, the police came to Light Labs to arrest the good doctor, but Light went along quietly to prove his innocence. Meanwhile, Mega Man went after the Robot Masters and, after he defeated a few of them, discovered that they were scheduled to be decommissioned and sent to the junkyard because they had reached the expiration date assigned to them by the government. Once the final Robot Master had been taken down, Mega Man brought back one of the robot's internal memory units to Auto for investigation. As it turned out, Dr. Wily had reprogrammed the robots, who were scheduled for demolition, to rise up against their human masters rather than be destroyed. All the robots wanted to do was have a purpose, and they certainly did not want to be sent to the scrap heap.    After they had viewed the video, Dr. Wily burst into their lab and stole the memory circuit and then withdrew to his newly constructed Wily Castle. Mega Man made his way through the fortress, fighting powerful robots built with the money Wily received from donations from those concerned with the robot uprisings. In the end, Mega Man defeated Wily once again, and showed him footage of every single defeat he had dealt Wily. Although Wily seemed contrite and apologetic, he tricked Mega Man into thinking that Dr. Light was, in fact, imprisoned in a jail cell in the next room. Although Proto Man warned him that it was a trap, Mega Man went to investigate the cell and was electrocuted by the Dr. Light decoy that was in the cell instead. As Wily's lab self-destructed, Proto Man returned and teleported Mega Man out of the lab just in time.    In the end, Light was released from prison. He then found useful purposes for all of the Robot Masters he had designed, which had reached their expiration dates.

Along the way he meets Raspberyl who introduces herself as an old friend of Mao and the Academy's Number 1 Delinquent (as she does all her homework, has perfect attendance and volunteers in her spare time).

Eventually Mao gets away with Almaz as class starts and Beryl cannot be late.

The buzz grows to a roar, and something can be heard launching from the craft. A hoard of Jacks suddenly burst through the ceiling, invading the compound.  At first Heihachi thinks that Kazuya has orchestrated the invasion. Kazuya, however, is roused by the rumbling and shaking, and obviously doesn't know what is going on either.  ""Who are you?!""  Just as Heihachi shouts, the Jacks attack both of them. Heihachi and Kazuya are forced to fight together and begin destroying the Jacks.

119995,494,Bulletstorm,"Bulletstorm takes place in the 26th century, where the Confederation of Planets are protected by a secret black-ops army called Dead Echo, commanded by General Sarrano. One Dead Echo team, led by Grayson Hunt (Steven Blum), having been following Sarrano's orders in assassinating what they believe are drug traffickers and mass murderers, kill a man known as Bryce Novak, but soon discover he was a civilian reporter, having documented other civilian deaths caused by Dead Echo. Grayson and his team realize they have been duped by Sarrano and go AWOL, becoming space pirates on the run from Sarrano's forces, now going by the name Final Echo.  Ten years later, Grayson's team tries to flee from Sarrano's battlecruiser, the Ulysses, while near the planet of Stygia. With their ship's systems failing, Grayson, in a drunken stupor, orders the crew to ram at the Ulysses, hoping to gain revenge on Sarraro. The ships collide, forcing both down and causing them to crash land on the surface of Stygia. One of Grayson's men, Ishi Sato (Andrew Kishino), is critically wounded in the crash and Grayson is forced to find an energy cell to drive the ship's medical equipment. On the planet, a former popular tropical-like resort destination, the population has mutated into feral tribes and carnivorous plants. Grayson fights through to one of the Ulysses escape pods, where a Final Echo soldier succumbs to a horde of mutants. After dispatching the attackers, Grayson retrieves the escape pod's energy cell, as well as an ""instinct leash"" that, when worn, begins to provide him strange tactile information, such as points for each enemy he kills.  Grayson returns with the cell, and while Ishi is under operation, the mutants attack their ship. The operation is cut short by an explosion during battle, leaving Ishi a disfigured cyborg. Grayson and Ishi, the only survivors, decide to work together to get off the planet, despite Ishi's disapproval of Grayson's thirst for revenge. The instinct leash leads Grayson to another escape pod, where they find Trishka (Jennifer Hale), another Final Echo soldier who agrees to work with Grayson and Ishi, but only after they rescue Sarrano. As they battle through the ravaged city, Trishka explains that Stygia has been used by Final Echo as a sort of training grounds, with the instinct leashes the soldiers wear as a means of ranking those within the test; those that scored kills would be the only ones that could get ammunition and other supplies to survive. When Grayson learns that Trishka was Novak's daughter, he tells her that Sarrano was responsible for her father's death, but claims he does not know who actually killed him.  The three make their way to the top of a skyscraper where Sarrano's pod landed. Trishka accuses Sarrano of her father's death, but he simply kicks her off the side of the building. Sarrano then warns Grayson and Ishi that there is an armed DNA bomb on the Ulysses that will wipe out all life on the planet, and that they must go and disarm it, as his rescue ship will not arrive in time. Sarrano leads them through the underground areas of the city, encountering radioactive waste and a giant prison. Sarrano snidely explains that that shields used to protect the planet's surface from its deadly electrical storms created the waste, and in turn, began to mutate the population of the surface; the changes occurred too quickly for most of the surface population to be rescued, and thus many of the feral mutants that Grayson has been fighting were more innocent civilians. Grayson is furious at this revelation, but continues to help Sarrano to reach the remains the Ulysses. Aboard, Sarrano tricks Grayson and Ishi once again, having them actually arm the DNA bomb, while his rescue ship will arrive in time to save him. As fire breaks out aboard the fallen ship, the two are saved by Trishka, who survived the fall by catching a power line on her way down.  The three race to where Sarrano's rescue ship is landing and manage to get on board. They make their way through Sarrano's elite troops and eventually face Sarrano alone. Trishka demands to know who actually killed her father, to which Sarrano indicts Grayson. In the confusion, Sarrano hijack's Ishi's computer systems, forcing him to turn on his friends. Grayson manages to break Sarrano's control of Ishi, and Ishi sacrifices himself to prevent Sarrano from killing Grayson. Grayson then impales Sarrano on the wall of a ship. As Grayson and Trishka regroup, Sarrano performs one final act, ejecting Grayson, Trishka and several of his men from the ship back onto the planet. With the DNA bomb soon to detonate, Grayson and Trishka race back to the Ulysses where one escape pod remains unlaunched; they are able to board it and escape into low orbit, out of range of the DNA bomb when it goes off.",2011-02-22 00:00:00.000,82,NULL,87.1429,10,79.8751,265

166132,15432,The King of Fighters 2001,"The official story given by Eolith is as follows:  ""An entire city was wiped off the globe with the use of the satellite weapon, Zero Cannon, during King of Fighters 2000.  This incident was reported to be the result of an artificial satellite crashing to earth, and adorned the front pages to various newspapers of countries all over the world.  A legion of individuals called for the end to the KOF tournament which always invited some sort of accident, but ironically this fighting tournament with a bad history once again regained considerable popularity.  The interest in the tournament rivaled that of the '97 contest, nay, exceeded perhaps exceeded it.  But for this tournament carried out on the international stage, an astonishing fact came to light.  A team from NESTS has entered the tournament!  What are the true objectives of the event's sponsor? There's no guarantee that even with this tournament, tragedy will not repeat itself....  The third title in the King of Fighters: The NESTS Chronicles. At last, this tournament will end it all!""  The NESTS cartel decides to host the 2001 KOF tournament so that they can use it as a method to eliminate their enemies and enter their own team into the ranks.  In the tournament finals, the Hero Team boards a special blimp that is soon revealed to be a spaceship. There they meet Original Zero, whose clone decimated the cartels' secrecy with his scheme in the previous year. He congratulates them for reaching the finals and states that they're headed for NESTS's real headquarters. He decides to entertain his passengers with a match and is backed up by his pet black lion Glugan, Ron, and Krizalid. Despite the oppressive force of his group, he is defeated moments before the ship docks at NESTS's space satellite. He stays on board the exploding ship and urges the Hero team to proceed forward.  Once inside NESTS's satellite, they face the NESTS leader, Nests. He expresses wishes for his renegade agents to return to the organization and is soon afterward killed by Igniz, who claims ownership of the cartel. Igniz also reveals that K', Kula, Krizalid, K9999 and Whip are guinea pigs/creations made for his own personal entertainment. Kula, who was separated from the rest of her team and present at the time, also heard her origin as an artificial life form. Declaring himself a god, he assaults the team as his first act of ""divine retribution"" and defeats them. As soon as he's about to kill K', other fighters came to intervene and help in the fight including all team leaders, Kyo and Iori. When he's defeated, he proclaims that he is fallen god and names himself a ""demon"" instead. He plunges the satellite through earth's atmosphere in an attempt to demolish his competition.  Thankfully, the satellite crashes into the ocean and the fighters aboard were somehow saved from the explosion, presumably thanks to Ron. K' saves Kula from drowning; in gratitude, she and her guardian, Diana, ally themselves with K' and company. K9999 and Angel are presumably still alive though their exact whereabouts are unknown. Foxy is also stabbed by them though her apparent on screen death is later revealed to be false.",2001-01-15 00:00:00.000,5,NULL,87.0000,1,66.4197,28
