12058,6002,Rent-A-Hero No. 1,"The player is Tarou Yamada, an ordinary boy from the Yamada family that just moved to the Koja Town. The Yamadas made a party to celebrate the move and meet the residents, but during the party, the food was almost ending. Tarou asked for more food from a delivery named Service Cafe (Seca for short), but he received a cosplay costume instead. Thinking of using it to boost the party by making a hero show with his father, who was dressed as a monster, he wore the costume and discovered that it gave him powers, accidentally throwing his father far away with a light tap. Checking it, he discovers that it is the top work from Seca, a sturdy and powerful super energy combat armor that can make anyone a hero, but it requires batteries to work. Also, as it is a rental suit, Tarou decides to start a rental job under the name Rent a Hero, and distributes flyers around the town to take requests. The money he gains is used for the costume's monthly rental fee and for batteries.    After finishing the distribution and returning home to play on his creamcast (the game's save point), he went out to check the town and saw a man harassing a woman, entering in a fight against him. Although helping outside the shop requests won't give rewards, it rises awareness of the hero, improving his career. Tarou then gradually gains experience and becomes a famous hero.",2000-05-25 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

26687,786,MechWarrior 4: Vengeance,"The FedCom Civil War engulfs Kentares IV after William Dresari, a nephew of famed Clan War hero Duke Eric Dresari, betrays the family, launching a surprise attack by Steiner forces on the Dresari royal palace. William seizes the throne for himself under the banner of Katherine ""Katrina"" Steiner-Davion's Lyran Alliance and became responsible for the annihilation of loyalists to Victor Steiner-Davion. The betrayal leaves Eric Dresari and the majority of the royal family dead.  Upon hearing of the coup, Eric's son, Ian Dresari, returns home and meets up with his uncle, Sir Peter Dresari, on the moon orbiting Kentares to launch a guerrilla campaign to take back Kentares IV from the Steiner loyalists. Ian fights alongside with fellow Resistance MechWarriors Casey Nolan, Jen McQuarrie, and Jules Gonzales, and their commander Elise Rathburn in various missions. The Resistance abandons its base on the moon and sets up camp for the first time in Kentares' arctic regions. At one point during this campaign, Ian's uncle Peter is murdered by Duncan Burke, a high-ranking officer in Katrina's forces. Ian and the rest of the Resistance are devastated by the loss of his uncle and debate over whether or not to continue the fight for Kentares' freedom. They decide to push forward and manage to capture a satellite network from House Steiner. The rebel group moves into the mountains.  After destroying a disabled, but heavily guarded Steiner DropShip, Ian and the resistance move to the Hadra Peninsula, a remote desert region. Rumors of an abandoned prison camp reached the resistance and efforts are made to locate and liberate the camp in order to enlist more personnel for the Resistance cause. Along the way, Ian is shocked to find that one member of his family survived Steiner's siege of the Dresari palace: his sister Joanna. After a short reunion, Ian and Joanna are separated once more as the Resistance plans to mobilize their forces to take the fight to Steiner. While in Hadra, Ian kills James Kulin, who was tasked with suppressing the civilian population of Kentares and personally gave the orders to execute Ian and Joanna's family. They make a brief detour to save a coastal town named Vale after Steiner threatened to bomb the town due to allegations of links to the Resistance. Not only does the Resistance save the population, but Ian manages to personally defeat his uncle's murderer, Duncan Burke, in a heated duel.  Pushing forward into urban environments, the fighting heats up and the Resistance's casualties mount. Joanna informs Ian of an old armory cache hidden somewhere in the city full of equipment enough to outfit four heavy lances of 'Mechs - valuable for assaulting the Dresari palace, now the headquarters for the Steiner occupation. Before the search for the cache could be conducted however, Joanna and her lance are ambushed by Steiner forces, leaving her badly injured and in mortal danger. Ian has to make a choice, between rescuing his sister from certain death or securing the weapons cache for an assault on the Dresari palace. Whatever the player chooses, Ian and the Resistance fight one last battle against House Steiner, finally putting an end to the war. However, the fight is not yet over for Ian, as William shows up in a modified Daishi, challenging Ian to a duel. Ian defeats William and finally frees the planet from Steiner's grasp.  Depending what choice the player makes during the second-to-last mission, either Joanna or Ian will ascend the throne as Duchess or Duke, respectively.",2000-11-22 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,70.4460,10

30012,11230,StarLancer,"It is the year 2160. Mankind has colonized the solar system and two political entities have emerged: the Alliance consisting of American, Australian, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, British and German forces, and The Coalition of Russian, Chinese and Middle-Eastern interests. The game begins with a surprise attack on Fort Kennedy, where a peace treaty turns into a bloodbath: all of the inner four planets are overrun, including Terra herself, and the Italian and French fleets are utterly lost. The Alliance fleet regroups at Triton, Neptune's moon, and attempts to regain lost territory. The player takes the role of a rookie pilot in the international 45th Volunteers squadron, under the command of Captain Robert Foster and Wing Commander Maria Enriquez, aboard the re-commissioned British carrier ANS Reliant.  As with Wing Commander: Prophecy, the pilot's flying ability is the only meter by which success and failure is measured, though Starlancer does not feature as many branching mission paths. As in Wing Commander I the pilot may be promoted throughout the course of the campaign; unlike WCI, their rank determines which fighters and missiles they may choose to employ during each mission. The game provides a ""virtual carrier"" through which to navigate, including nearby crewmembers whose reaction to you depends on your current rank and standing. However, the true gem of the game lies in its textual and video news broadcasts, which keep the player informed as to the status of the rest of the war, which seems to be progressing just over the horizon. Players frequently find themselves flying alongside squadrons and pilots they have heard about on the news just recently, providing a dose of 'celebrity exposure' and also increasing the sensation that they are just one part of a much larger war effort.  Starlancer's story is continued in Chris Roberts' Freelancer project, though the two belong to different subgenres (the first is purely focused on action, the latter also features trading and the player can freely move through the game's universe when they are not on a mission.)",2000-03-31 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,70.0000,1,85.7503,9

35192,15863,Crimson Skies,"In 1937, Nathan Zachary and the Fortune Hunters were recovering from the foul betrayal of Lucas Miles in the skies over Cuba by hunting for the lost treasure of Sir Francis Drake. Locating Drake's Gold, the Fortune Hunters find evidence of British interest in Hawaii, and are set upon by the Medusas. While victorious, the Fortune Hunters are curious as to the reason for the British presence. Seizing a British Balmoral leads them to a secret British base, which they promptly destroy. Fighting off a counterattacks from HMS Barracuda, the Fortune Hunters are able to make repairs to the Pandora using the British facilities and recovered Drake's Gold, despite last-minute interference from the Royal Air Force.    Rejoicing in their newfound wealth, the Fortune Hunters cancel their party when they receive a distress call from an old friend - Ilsa Fassenbiender, daughter of Doctor Wilhelm Fassenbiender, radios the Fortune Hunters with news that her father has been kidnapped by the Soviet secret police, while she herself is kept prisoner by Boeing Aviation in Pacifica. The Fortune Hunters launched an assault on the CCCP zeppelin Workers' Voyage to retrieve the doctor, which resulted in Nathan Zachary once again encountering his old flame, the Black Swan. Successful in their flying rescue, the Fortune Hunters attempt to repeat their success with a lightning raid on the Boeing plant, hoping to both rescue Ilsa and steal the prototype Hughes Bloodhawk, Blue Streak. Again successful, the Fortune Hunters are forced to strike agains the USSR once again - this time attacking a petrol tanker off the coast of Pacifica to refuel the Pandora. Returning to Pacifica, the Fortune Hunters attack a zeppelin belonging to Blake Aviation Security in a pre-emptive strike which is an unmigitigated success.    Shortly after this victory, the Fortune Hunters found themselves battling a new enemy. The previously unknown pirate gang, the Black Hats, had shot down the Workers' Voyage, an act that might not have been possible had the Fortune Hunters not destroyed its escorts. Consumed with guilt, the Fortune Hunters descended upon the wreckage, driving off the Black Hats and ensuring the survival of the hospital ship sent in to rescue survivors.    Flush with victory and with two of the most brilliant aircraft designers in the world in tow, the Fortune Hunters head south, for the Nation of Hollywood. Although their original intention was merely to rescue a movie starlet trapped by her contract, the Fortune Hunters followed another successful rescue with the theft of the world's largest airplane and participating in the first Johnson Cup Race, which Nathan Zachary won by a considerable margin. This victory, on Johnny Johnson's home turf, drove him to attempt a nefarious plan to destroy Zachary. When that failed, he used the delay caused by the race to send a Hughes Aviation combat zeppelin to destroy the Fortune Hunters' Pandora. While the assault resulted in the destruction of the Hughes Aviation zeppelin, the Pandora was badly damaged. Fleeing inland, the Fortune Hunters were forced to hijack the cargo zeppelin Figaro to provide the Pandora with a tow.    Arriving in Sky Haven, the Fortune Hunters encountered Black Swan and her group. With both sides willing to let bygones be bygones, the party went late into the night.    The next morning, however, Zachary awoke to find his crew missing, and his only ally the Black Swan, whose crew had also mysteriously disappeared. Hunting the area around Sky Haven, Zachary picked up a transmission from Sparks, the Pandora's pilot. He was aboard the Rocky Express. Zachary hastened to rescue his pilot, but the Express was attacked by Black Hats. The Express was escorted by Hellhounds from Sacred Trust Incorporated... who were expecting the Black Hats. Zachary and the Black Swan drove off both the pirates and the supposed security, disabled the Express' defences, and scooped up Sparks seconds before the Express' locomotive exploded.    Convinced the Black Hats are responsible for the disappearance of their crews, Zachary and the Black Swan determine to hunt down a member of the Black Hats leadership... Ulysses Boothe. Finding Boothe, Zachary was able to shoot him down and capture him, and proposed to trade him back to the Hats in exchange for the return of the crews. Furious, but without options, Boothe agreed. Zachary dropped Boothe at the agreed-upon location, only to be told that the crews were being held inside a cargo zeppelin which had been wired with explosives. With consummate skill, Zachary was able to shoot free the zeppelin, board it, and release the crews. While the crews escaped, Black Swan herself was shot down and captured on the ground.    Together, the Fortune Hunters and the Black Swans proceeded to decimate the Black Hats' operations in Sky Haven, culminating in the utter destruction of their mountaintop base, the theft of dozens of aerial torpedoes and the rescue of the Black Swan.    Realising there had to be a secret alliance between the Black Hats and Sacred Trust, Zachary was forced to approach the one man who might be able to help them... Paladin Blake. While initially distrustful, Zachary was able to convince Blake of his sincerity and recruit him to assist the Fortune Hunters in their efforts to exterminate both the Black Hats and Sacred Trust.    Heading for the Sacred Trust HQ in Manhattan, Zachary contacted an old friend of his, who lead him to an Sacred Trust warehouse crammed with illegal merchandise, which was being loaded onto a German freighter. Destroying the warehouse and the freighter, Zachary was able to draw official attention to the activities of Sacred Trust.    However, the Fortune Hunters needed more evidence. Evidence such as that known by Waldo Carney, Sacred Trust's accountant, who was trying to flee the city. When his zeppelin was attacked by Black Hats, the Fortune Hunters were able to rescue him and transport him safely to police HQ.    Convinced their secrets had been revealed, Sacred Trust attempted to flee the city, loading their remaining contraband and documents onto zeppelins. However, the Fortune Hunts and Blake Aviation Security were able to disable their zeppelins, as well as the stolen Spruce Goose, and prevent Sacred Trust from removing the vital evidence.    Furious at these repeated defeats, the true master behind both the Black Hats and Sacred Trust revealed himself - Lucas Miles, the man who had betrayed the Fortune Hunters in Cuba. In his mighty zeppelin Dante, Miles attempted to flee, but his zeppelin and his fighters were no match for the combined force of the Fortune Hunters and Blake Aviation Security. The Dante was shot down, and Miles was killed.    Victorious once again, the Fortune Hunters accepted a substantial reward from the government of the Empire State, and decided to take a tropical break to spend it. Sea Haven is always nice this time of the year...",2000-09-17 00:00:00.000,3,NULL,80.0000,1,75.2981,16

37961,4116,Syphon Filter 2,"Hours after the events of the first game, Gabriel Logan and Lian Xing are enemies of the state to the Agency after uncovering its connection to Syphon Filter, labeled as terrorists to the general public. Agency operative Dillon Morgan captures Lian at the PharCom warehouses, forcing Gabe and the CBDC soldiers to rendezvous with ex-Agency operative Teresa Lipan in Arizona. Simultaneously, the Agency scrambles a squadron of F-22 Raptors to intercept their transport over the Colorado Rockies, so Gabe and CBDC Lieutenant Jason Chance head down the mountain in search of their plane and a box of PharCom data disks. Agency operative Steven Archer attempts to stop them at all costs.  A group of conspirators, including Mara Aramov and Agency director Lyle Stevens, make a deal to deliver the virus to a rogue Chinese general named Shi-Hao. Meanwhile, Lian recovers in a U.S. Air Force base where Morgan, Derek Falkan, and Thomas Holman are working with Dr. Elsa Weissinger of PharCom to extract infected plasma from test subjects. Lian learns that the other subject was PharCom CEO Jonathan Phagan, who survived his gunshot wound long enough for the Agency to take the plasma. Weissinger protests that Phagan is useful and should be kept alive for further research, but Morgan, not intending that the U.S. government find Pharcom's CEO infected with an unknown virus, deactivates his life support, tying up a loose end.  Lian escapes the medical building and interrogates Holman to learn that Morgan is planning another operation to the PharCom Expo Center to find an encryption disk. She leaves the base in a helicopter after killing Falkan and teams up with Gabe to battle Archer's forces. Gabe shoots Archer during his escape, and recovers the PharCom data.  The protagonists follow Holman's lead to the Expo Center and kill Morgan before he can recover the disk he sought. After decrypting the PharCom data, Teresa realises that some information is missing. The other half must be with Russian SVR director Uri Gregorov, who appeared at the warehouses before Gabe left. Since Lian and Uri know each other, they agree to meet in Moscow.  Aramov instigates a gunfight while they meet and Lian pursues Gregorov. Lian later learns he is an impostor working for Mara and trying to find the other half of the data. The man admits that the real Gregorov is in a Russian gulag, Aljir Prison, which once held Lian captive. Gregorov uncovered a plot to sell the virus to Shi-Hao, so Aramov intervened. Lian stops Gregorov's execution, but is almost killed by the virus and collapses. Gabe takes her back to the States, while Gregorov promises to handle Shi-Hao.  Gabe and Teresa arrive back at the Virginia safehouse overseen by Lawrence Mujari, a freelance pathologist. They decide to trade the PharCom data to the Agency for Lian's vaccine. Director Stevens double-crosses Gabe in the Agency's New York City labs, but Logan escapes and forces Dr. Weissinger to give him the vaccine. Gabe also finds out that Chance survived the mission in Colorado, and sets him free.  Pursued by NYPD SWAT cops and Agency personnel, Gabe hurries back to their helicopter. Along the way, Logan is forced to provide cover for a SWAT officer whose partner is wounded. He does so, but Stevens, who later takes the cop hostage, orders him to drop his weapons. Despite Logan complying in surrender, Stevens kills the officer anyway. Before he can get shot, Gabe is thrown into the sewers by an explosion that Teresa sets off. Gabe assumes that Chance was killed in the labs since Teresa says he never made it to the helicopter. Gabe and Teresa eventually corner Stevens and Gabe shoots him in cold blood.  Gabe and Teresa reach the helicopter to find Chance waiting in impenetrable Agency-issued body armor. He was really working for them, and he shoots Teresa. Gabe suspected it since the Agency always knew where he was in Colorado. Both men fight, and Gabe kills the man he trusted with an assault shotgun that drives Chance into the helicopter blades, decapitating him.  A news report reveals that the Agency's existence is now public, and U.S. Secretary of State Vincent Hadden promises that the government will investigate. Gabe cures Lian and demarcates a grave for Teresa. He, Lian, and Lawrence hold a small memorial and promise to keep fighting, while soldiers watch them from a distance. In a post-credits scene, Hadden and Aramov emerge from a helicopter, with Aramov saying that the Administration will soon fall allowing Hadden to become President. Although a team of soldiers requests for permission to kill Gabe and his team, Hadden calls off the operation, telling Mara he has other plans for Gabe. Aramov laughs as the screen fades to black.",2000-03-14 00:00:00.000,24,NULL,NULL,NULL,79.6946,57

Kurow Kirishima: a cold-hearted and ruthless ninja assassin from a mysterious group known only as the ""Reverse Society"" has his sight set on the Imawano family and plans to eliminate them and their allies so that he can prepare for the advancement of his own ambition to rule Japan.

Lastly, Kurow himself plans to destroy Batsu's reputation by disguising himself as Batsu's doppelganger (named Vatsu) so that he can attack the fighters and make them believe that Batsu is behind it.

Interaction between the two planets has been infrequent over the last few centuries despite their proximity; the Bridge of Light linked Inferia and Celestia in the distant past, but the link has been severed for an extensive period of time. The Aurora War, an ancient conflict that set Inferia against Celestia over two thousand years ago, continues to generate persistent mistrust between the two groups. The Orbus Barrier has shown recent signs of weakening and possible collapse due to the actions of an unknown external force.

79291,80821,The Mummy,"Ardeth Bay addresses the player directly, saying that they have released an ancient evil fear for three millennia. The player then takes over as Rick O'Connell, who is situated in the catacombs of Hamunaptra and begins making his way through the tunnels, killing off thieves and taking any artifacts he can find. O’Connell then operates the opening mechanisms for the tunnel doors, wherein he finds more artifacts and more thieves to be defeated, with a new menace coming in the form of scarabs, which are burned away with the torch that O’Connell must light. Going further into the catacombs, O’Connell states that he has a bad feeling and makes his way into a pit, at which point a dried, raspy inhuman voice shouts in ancient Egyptian and mummies erupt from the ground, which are more challenging to kill than the thieves. After dispatching the mummies and escaping the pit, O’Connell goes in further to find more undead minions, these dressed in blue and gold trimmings and prove harder to kill than the mummies, requiring three strikes of the sword. These are defeated, however, and O’Connell encounters more grave robbers before going further into the catacombs, finding a room filled with some treasure pieces which are taken, before moving on to reach another corridor filled with mummies. In time, O’Connell reaches a sarcophagus that is opened, revealing a sword that shines blue. O’Connell then leaves the chamber.",2000-11-17 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The war against humanoids left him without family and now his only motivation is to fight the mechanical men, but he receives an order from the supreme commander: to hunt a space pirate called Captain Harlock, who is said to be allied with the mechanical men.  Zero faces a difficult situation, as Harlock was the one who trained him and he only assaults the ships of the mechanical men. Determined to find the truth, Zero accepts the mission.

84103,140838,Breakout,"The Breakout world of 2000 is an island filled with bizarre creatures in the form of paddles and balls. Bouncer enjoys his life their with Daisy, his beautiful girlfriend. All was fine in paradise until one day when Bouncer took a swim out to sea to rescue a ball. While Bouncer was gone, the evil Batnix and his henchmen kidnapped Daisy.      When Bouncer returned, he was imprisoned in a dark and dank jail cell. To prevent Bouncer's friends from busting him out of prison, Batnix put them in jails all across the world. Bouncer attempted to escape on his own, but he was caught and affixed to a ball and chain. Luckily, the ball was friendly and let Bouncer smack him against the wall, shattering the bricks and mortar, freeing both ball and paddle from prison. Now, Bouncer must rescue all his friends.      The paddle you control in Breakout can be angled or curved so that you can aim the ball more precisely and hit objects that aren't directly in front of you. As you progress through the game, you can add paddle friends (each with a unique skill) to your arsenal and call on them at any time to take Bouncer's place. Also, there are many power-ups to collect, such as Extra Life, Big Paddle, and Grab Ball, which lets you catch the ball and reposition it prior to shooting it at an object.      Most of the levels in Breakout require you to hit the ball in order to knock down and demolish obstructions. However, some of the levels are less simplistic, requiring you to perform such tasks as knock down targets in a specific order. In a few of the levels, Bouncer must get up on two feet and do things most paddles have never dreamed of (you'll have to play the game to find out what).      After you complete a level, you will be ranked according to performance. The higher your ranking, the harder the challenge. To improve your ranking, you can repeat earlier levels.",2000-09-23 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Motohide is later betrayed and killed by Toda, only to be betrayed and killed himself by his chief assassin Lady Kagami: the founder of the Burning Dawn. Over an unknown period of time following the death of Lord Toda, the Burning Dawn partake in a series of underground criminal activities such as kidnapping, theft, forced labor, smuggling and murder.

Once upon a time, the great barbarian King Jarg ruled over those lands. But then the Wizards of Bracaduun came and enslaved the barbarian people. Young Tarnum learns the long-lost history of his people from the last bards and decides to do anything to break the Wizards' rule. Becoming the new Barbarian King, he leads the clans against Bracaduun.  After the death of the woman he fell in love with, Yalla, and the murder of one of the bards by the wizards, Tarnum's noble intentions become a sinister quest for blood and revenge. Decided to destroy the Wizard-Kings at all costs, he enslaves the inhabitants of the Mudlands and orders villages of ""traitors"" to be burned to the ground, even causing the death of one of his long-lost sisters.  After months of campaign and terrible battles, his advisors express their hope to get back to their home, but Tarnum doesn't listen, obsessed by taking the fortress of Steelhorn. To avoid a rebellion, he has his advisors poisoned, including his old friend Hardac. Accusing the Wizards of his crime, he turns his army into a blood-thirsty Horde. Victory is at hand, but at a terrible cost: Tarnum is now known as the Barbarian Tyrant and has become everything he despised in the Wizards.  Some time later, survivors from Bracaduun flee to the north and found the kingdom of Erathia. During a campaign to conquer the young kingdom, Tarnum is defeated by its first king Rion Gryphonheart. Tarnum soon discovers that Paradise is closed to him. Because of his crimes against his own people, the Ancestors have cursed him to wander the world eternally until he make up for ""the tremendous wrongs he performed"".  It is also worth noting that Gavin Magnus, the future Immortal King of Bracada, was present at the battle of Steelhorn and ""killed"" by one of Tarnum's behemoths. He then discovered he was in fact immortal.",2000-09-27 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,50.6008,7

116838,19007,Skies of Arcadia,"The game takes place in the fictional skies referred to as Arcadia, where six civilizations coexist on floating continents orbited by six moons of different colors. Thousands of years prior to the present time of the game, the civilizations, one of which existed for each moon, developed technologically to the point where each created a Gigas, a colossal living weapon of mass destruction, controlled by a Moon Crystal. Using the Gigas, the civilizations warred with one another, threatening the extinction of humanity. The most advanced, the Silver Civilization, used their Gigas to summon the Rains of Destruction, which pulled meteors from the orbiting moons and crashed them down onto the planet's surface. The catastrophic destruction stopped the rampage of the Gigas, as well as nearly destroyed the other five civilizations, thus ending the war. A seal was placed on the Silver Gigas to prevent it from being used again, and the Moon Crystals were hidden away, while each civilization worked on rebuilding itself.    Vyse and Aika are members of the Blue Rogues, a faction of Robin Hood-minded air pirates gathered together to resist the militant and tyrannical Valuan Empire. Led by Empress Teodora, the empire seeks the Moon Crystals to reawaken the Gigas and take over the world. Teodara directs the Valuan Armada, a fleet of warships led by admirals Galcian and Ramirez, to find them. Upon the Silver Civilization learning of this plan, they send Fina to find the Moon Crystals first. She is captured by the Armada, but saved by Vyse and Aika, who, with mutual enemies, agree to help her mission.",2000-10-05 00:00:00.000,12,NULL,90.0000,1,83.3320,27

MI6 agent James Bond is sent to Bilbao, Spain to meet a Swiss banker and retrieve money for Robert King, a friend of M who purchased a classified report from the Russian Atomic Energy Department. The report, which was taken from a dead MI6 agent, is believed to contain information about terrorists who have attacked King's oil pipeline in Kazakhstan. Bond asks the banker who killed the MI6 agent, but he is unexpectedly killed by an assassin. Bond escapes with the money and takes it to the MI6 headquarters in London. A terrorist group then launches an attack on the MI6 headquarters, prompting Bond to pursue the assassin through a London Underground station. Bond offers her protection, but she ultimately kills herself by exploding a hot air balloon. The MI6 traces the recovered money to a KGB agent-turned-terrorist known as Renard, who previously kidnapped King's daughter, Elektra. M assigns Bond to protect Elektra, who is about to oversee the construction of an oil pipeline in Azerbaijan.  During a tour of the pipeline's proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, paraglider-equipped snowmobiles. Bond suspects the attack was caused by Elektra's head of security, Davidov, and decides to kill him before taking his place on a flight to a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. There, Bond meets nuclear physicist Christmas Jones and learns that Renard managed to steal plutonium from a nuclear warhead. To get a lead on where Renard might be hiding, Bond visits a former Russian mafia adversary, Valentin Zukovsky, who reveals that Elektra was in exchange for the use of a submarine currently being captained by his nephew. Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. In Istanbul, Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine, while Bond is taken to the Maiden's Tower. With the help of Zukovsky, Bond kills Elektra and boards the submarine. Ultimately, Bond finds Renard in the submarine's reactor and kills him before escaping with Jones.",2000-10-17 00:00:00.000,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Skizzik tells Tarnum that the Ancestors are imprisoned on the Fiery Moon, which can only be reached through the Sparkling Bridge. The Sparkling Bridge is an ancient portal capable of instigating travel to any world in the universe. It has been guarded by the elementals since the dawn of time and requires the Ring of the Wayfarer to be operated.

However, Tarnum's loses his battle against Vorr's army. Grumba also dies in the battle, but Skizzik survives.

Having lived with these green and gold dragons for twenty years, Tarnum sets out on a quest to find them. He leaves Adrienne, the fire witch, to look after the orphan boy Waerjak while he is gone. Tarnum appoints the dwarf Kurbon as his master of supplies, and the elves appoint the druid Aspen as Tarnum's advisor. Tarnum and Aspen frequently play chess together, but Tarnum's aggressive tactics cause him to lose each time.  Tarnum speaks to the Dragontalker about the disappearance of the good dragons. The Dragontalker tells Tarnum about Mutare, an overlord who used the Vial of Dragon's Blood to turn herself into the Dragon Queen of Nighon, thus enslaving all dragons, good and evil, to her will. Tarnum steals this vial and uses it on the ten kidnapped Gold Dragon Mothers in order to restore the good dragons to their normal selves. While he does so, he rescues the ranger Valita from a demonic prison. Aspen, once a great spy, suspects Captain Valita of spying for Nighon, but Tarnum refuses to believe this.  Tarnum continues to battle against Mutare, even after she gains power over the mighty Rust, Crystal and Azure Dragons. To gain an advantage over Mutare, Tarnum seeks the aid of the Faerie Dragons. Aspen captures the harpy messenger who carries the spy reports to and from Nighon. The harpy claims that the notes are stuck to a tree with an arrow of green and black fletchings (the colors of Valita's arrows). Tarnum realizes that Kurbon is the spy because he knows all the troop movements and supplies the arrows for Valita whom he trained while in the Forest Guard. Kurbon shoots Aspen (who dies a few weeks later) before fleeing into Nighon.  Tarnum's lightning assault pushes Mutare back into Nighon territory, but now she focuses all of her forces against him. Valita is captured by the traitor, Kurbon. Tarnum eventually frees her by reminding Kurbon of who he really is, which leads to dwarf's second betrayal, this time of Mutare. Kurbon sacrifices his troops and his own life to liberate Valita. After Tarnum's victory on the border, Mutare is forced to retreat further into Nighon to plot Tarnum's death. Tarnum progresses further into Nighon and battles Mutare herself, crushing her armies and forcing her to flee. While weakened Mutare plans her revenge in Nighon, she is killed by unknown person in a coup for power, just like she herself once came to rule the Dungeons. Tarnum is called away again by the Ancestors, but he will always remember the time he spent in AvLee as the happiest time of his life.",2000-11-15 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,40.7651,7

127821,8434,Heroes Chronicles: Masters of the Elements,"In Masters of the Elements, a ten thousand-year truce between the Elemental Lords of Air, Earth, Water, and Fire comes to an end. The Ancestors send Tarnum to stop this feud before it destroys the material world. The only way to access the elemental planes is to take control of the last remaining Elemental Conflux in Enroth. Using the forces of Gavin Magnus, the Immortal Grand Vizier of Bracada, Tarnum conquers the last Conflux and discovers the location of the Gateway to the Clouds.  Upon reaching the Plane of Air, Tarnum discovers that Shalwend, Lord of Air, has already departed his realm. When Shalwend destroys the Gateway to the Clouds behind Tarnum, Tarnum is forced to find another way to return to his world. He must become a master of all four elements before returning to Antagarich. He next travels to the Plane of Water where he learns that Acwalander, the Water Lord, has left his realm as well.  In the Plane of Earth, Tarnum is shocked to find that Reamus (a wizard who traveled to the plane 200 years ago) is still alive. Even stranger, only 16 years have passed on the Plane of Earth in that time. As Gralkor, the Earth Lord, has also left his plane, Tarnum and his men realize that the Elemental Lords are using the time variations between the material world and the planes in order to gain a foothold in the material world before Tarnum can return.  While in the Plane of Fire, Reamus and Barsolar (King Magnus's cousin and advisor to Tarnum) learn of the Plane of Magic. Magic binds the elements together, so they know it will give them the advantage they will need against the Elemental Lords. After receiving the aid of the magic elementals and returning to the Plane of Fire to free the Phoenixes enslaved by Pyrannaste, Lord of Fire, Tarnum leads his army back to the material world.  Thirty years have passed in the world since Tarnum had left. King Magnus brings an army to support Tarnum. While they are in camp, Magnus and Tarnum exchange stories. Tarnum learns that one of his Behemoths killed Magnus centuries ago in the battle for Castle Steelhorn, and that Magnus somehow awoke to find himself immortal and later became King of Bracada. However, Tarnum finds Magnus to be arrogant and self-righteous, refusing to consort with the man. Once the Elemental Lords are defeated, Tarnum sends his elemental troops back to their planes. He coldly lets Gavin Magnus know that the elementals will never return to Antagarich (even though they later do so in Armageddon's Blade) then asks the Magic Elementals to destroy all Confluxes and all records of the elemental planes before returning to his life as a Barbarian.",2000-11-15 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,41.4350,8

130398,106678,Xuan-Yuan Sword 3: The Scar of the Sky,"The main character is a young man named Chen Jingchou (陳靖仇, meaning ""To pacify the northern foes and to avenge Chen.""), the only royal descendant remaining from the decimated Chen Dynasty. The final attempt for counterattack from the Chen family happened several years before Chen Jingchou was born, when the tens-of-thousands-strong remnants of Chen forces were single-handedly wiped out by a 10-year-old Sui child, Yang Tuo (楊拓) (later known as Yuwen Tuo 宇文拓), a student of Yang Su.    Having lived under the reign of those who destroyed his kingdom, Chen Jingchou had been educated by his mentor, Chen Fu (陳輔), to pursue a life of vengeance and of reviving his kingdom. The first step of their journey to restore Chen was to acquire the Mirror of Kunlun, one of the Ten Great Ancient Artifacts.[2]    The ancient monstrosity Taotie was released from a mirror that was revealed to be a fake. In order to protect Jingchou, Fu trapped himself with Taotie using a potent Silk of Ice spell, and instructed Jingchou to embark at once to find a way to save him, as well as finding information concerning other Artifacts. As he set out on his journey, Jingchou summoned an elemental spirit familiar given to him by his master to accompany him on his journeys.    Jingchou later was later joined by Yu Xiaoxue (于小雪), a white haired girl showing unusual healing magic potential, the honorable half Göktürks-blooded hero Zhang Lie (張烈)[3] and Zhang's young sister-in-law Tuoba Yu'er (拓拔玉兒) of the Tuoba tribe, which kept the Shennong Ding for generations and was subject to indiscriminate slaughter by the Sui emperor's troops. During their expedition in collecting the Artifacts, they encountered several Blood Rituals of Ten Thousand Souls, rites conducted by Grand Preceptor Yuwen Tuo which involved the killing of ten thousand souls to gather their essences into a single Blood Pearl. The party attempted to intervene with the rituals, but Yuwen Tuo proved to be too formidable a foe. Thus they adopted the strategy of subterfuge, hampering his every effort to collect the Blood Pearls without direct confrontations, and was even helped in secret by a young princess named Dugu Ningke (獨孤寧珂), who held tremendous political power due to her relation with her uncle, the emperor, and protested Yuwen's actions.    Eventually, their plan failed, and Yu Xiaoxue was held as a hostage by Tuo in exchange for the Artifacts that Jingchou's party had collected, namely the Shennong Ding, the Seal of Kongtong, the Pangu Axe, the Nüwa Stone, and the Kunlun Mirror. Jingchou complied, yet Tuo discarded the Stone and the mirror as fakes, proclaiming that he himself was actually the human avatar of the Kunlun Mirror. Surprisingly, Yu Xiaoxue refused to leave with Jingchou, stating that she intended to stay and help Tuo's project, and seemingly betrays his trust by repelling his attack on Yuwen's plans wielding the Xuan-Yuan Sword. Losing all hope, Jingchou gave up his quest and opted to travel with his similarly disheartened mentor.    Ningke, who was actually a demon general dispatched from the western pantheon of Hell, was displeased with this turn of events. She infiltrated China by possessing the original Princess Dugu who died of illness, and arrived in anticipation of what was calculated to be the time a comet named Crimson Piercer (Chi Guan - 赤貫) would pass through the sky, opening a rift in the divine protective barrier of the Chinese lands and allowing an opportunity for demons from the West to invade. Tuo learned of the implications of the passage of the comet, and set out to collect five of the Artifacts in order to seal the rift the comet would cause in the Barrier of the Ninth Heaven in the firmament above Shenzhou. However, several of the five Artifacts required for the Ritual of Mending were nowhere to be found. Ningke proposed that he substitute these with Blood Pearls along with the construction of a Tower of Babel, and a Pentagram ritual formation. In order to save the Chinese world, using his power, his riches and his relation with the Emperor Yang, Tuo managed to accomplish these despite his moral misgivings. In the process, Tuo also discovered that Xiaoxue was actually the avatar of the Stone of Nüwa, as Artifacts resonate with each other when in close proximity. Consequently, he told her of his plan and convinced her to help him, leading to misunderstandings between her and Jingchou.    Ningke could not allow the Ritual to be abandoned and manipulated Jingchou through treachery by murdering Yu'er, who learned the truth behind the situation after going to the Grand Preceptor Residence in secret in an attempt to reconcile Xiaoxue and Jingchou, and framing Xiaoxue and Tuo. Fueled by anger and grief, Jingchou's party managed to reach the top of the Tower of Babel, where they were beaten once again by Tuo. Ningke suddenly appeared in the confusion and seized Xiaoxue as hostage to divert Tuo's attention. Jingchou took the opportunity and severed Tuo's arm. Ningke then revealed her true demon form, imprisoning Tuo with magic. Unable to mend the sky, the Chinese world fell under Satan's rule of death and destruction.    Days later, under the instruction of the now immortal He Ran and Gu Yuesheng (last seen in Xuan-Yuan Sword 2), Jingchou's group, which now also includes a young Li Shimin successfully retrieved the Artifacts from Ningke's handmaidens in the bloodied world, and returned to the Tower. They defeated Ningke with her full unrestricted power, and rescued Tuo. Having the Artifacts at hand, Jingchou and company invoked the Ritual of Reversal (which is also named the Ritual of Loss, 失卻之陣) at the top of Tower of Babel, which, utilizing the power of Tuo as the avatar the Mirror of Kunlun at the ritual formation's center, reversed time and brought the party back to the moment prior to the passing of Chi Guan.    The group invoked the Ritual of Trespass (also called the Ritual of Babel), sending them above the sky, and arrived at Chi Guan itself. Coming across the Heavenly Maiden White Jade Ring (天女白玉輪), an eight trigrams formation used by the deities Fuxi and Nüwa to revive their deceased daughter in ancient times, Jingchou had the choice to bring Yu'er back to life at the cost of expending a great deal of Xiaoxue's power. At the heart of the meteor, where the party prepared to cast the Ritual of Sealing, which caused the non-artifact casters to lose their most precious memories or ideals (with Zhang Lie losing his ambition of unifying the lands, Li Shimin losing his love for his family, and Jingchou losing his memories of Yu'er or his master depending on the ending), Ningke, then still alive and ignorant of the recent events Jingchou and his companions experienced, appeared and attempted to continue her deception, but a fight ensued, and Ningke was vanquished. The party decided to grant her final wishes: to be returned to her homeland, and to become free to love whom she loves. Gu stated that was impossible due to her demonic nature, and placed her soul into the Fuxi Qin (伏羲琴), which Yuwen Tuo brought with him on his self-imposed exile to the west, Ningke's homeland, after the events of the game for her soul to be cleansed eventually.    Chen Fu witnessed what appeared to be Jingchou assisting in the machinations of Yuwen Tuo, their sworn enemy. Ningke exploited this before heading to Chi Guan by giving Chen Fu the Fruit of Satan, a demonic object that grants power in exchange for sanity, deceiving him into battling against his student. Chen Fu soon arrived at the heart of Chi Guan with the intent to destroy it. Jingchou's group was left with no choice but to kill Chen Fu to save the world.",2000-12-02 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
